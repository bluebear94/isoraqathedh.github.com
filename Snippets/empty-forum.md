Title: Walking into an Empty Forum

# [%Title] [Title] #

Trawling my memory one Sunday evening,
I remembered an old roleplaying forum that I used to slurp data from.
Well, I thought, maybe I should go and take a look at how it's going.
So I did, and according to the records,
the most recent post on the forum
seemed to have been made some time in the middle of 2014.
"How curious!" I thought, "the place has definitely seen better days!"

Indeed, what I have been staring at
is what's left of a forum after being left to rot for a month or twenty.

The forum, as I have mentioned earlier, is a roleplay forum,
a place where users pretend to be some other subject
and generally have fun doing so.
Right now, however, as its inhabitants have largely forsaken them,
the worlds they have simulated are all but frozen,
like an insect encased in amber
(except not quite, in ways that I will detail later).
Characters say a line, waiting for a reply that will probably never come.
Settings become static snapshots, with no action planned.
Those in mid-fight –
there's got to be a few, although I have never actually seen one –
are probably quite sore right now as they held their positions,
waiting for the next instruction which would most likely never come.

But even though the timeline within each story is perfectly set in stone,
the medium in which it is told in is more akin to an abandoned city,
with things slowly breaking.
Images, of course, are the most noticeable victims in link rot,
and they are common here,
as each post has the character that is supposedly speaking those lines
jabber away in an animated image.
But as image hosts remove low-traffic and old images from their servers,
or shuffle them around, the links, unable to keep up with the changes, fail.
Undoubtedly, if I were to be much more diligent
and follow the authors around to see where their characters have gone,
they – the characters – would probably have changed quite a bit too,
if they weren't forgotten by their authors entirely,
or shuffled into the archives out of shame.
Imagine that, a whole world of characters,
with blood of every hue and strange protrusions atop the heads,
vanished, ended, changed without continuity,
because they received insufficient care from a land that they do not know of,
nor will they know of.
I am not very good at emotions, but I would think this is tragic,
for the characters if nothing else.
I think this is called sympathy,
and believe me when I say that humans *love* that stuff.

(A side thought:
the forum has a thread that lists lots and lots of character profiles,
detailing each and every one of them in great and perhaps excessive detail.
Were I to download all of them now
(at least those that still have a working image to them!),
take out the names, some details and maybe that weird pattern on the shirt,
would he still recognise his creation? Is he *willing* to do so?
What if I wait another two or three years? Ten?)

But no matter, what now, I thought,
now this virtual landscape has been left derelict and lifeless?
In a way the abandonedness of it gives it an eerie atmosphere,
with the dynamic stories made static
and the static format slowly falling apart.
But this is a fragile thing,
for if I were to reveal its identity,
the very source of the eerieness of worlds frozen in time will be broken,
as visiters might be invited to come in and attempt to revitalise the place.
This is a unique opportunity that seems to be unable to be shared.

For now, though, there's little that I can do
except to marvel at the slowly decaying forum
here in the lands where a Central American plant popular with the children grow.
