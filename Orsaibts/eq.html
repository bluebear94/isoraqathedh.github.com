<h1 id="Title">≟</h1>
<p>
	Nowadays it is very fashionable to style yourself as being "for equality".
	It seems like it is hard to walk three metres without meeting someone saying that.
	The interesting thing is that pointing that out and wondering if there is something more to it
	has actually gotten me into some hot water.
	Because of this, I will now use this webpage to explain the entirety of my thought process,
	so as to allay any concerns that I am "trolling" or somesuch.
</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>
	As you may probably know, I like Common Lisp a lot.
	One of the more baffling things about Lisp is how it has
	<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw51/CLHS/Body/f_eq.htm">
		a <em>lot</em> of ways to test if two things are "the same",
	</a>
	and although most of the time using <code>#'eql</code> and <code>#'=</code> will do fine,
	even those alternatives aren't enough in even the simplest programs at times;
	if you write your own data structure,
	you'd need to also write your own method to tell if two things are "equal".
	This brings us to the topic at hand today:
	"Equal" is simply not well-defined, but way too many people think it is.
	Now that there are a bewildering amount of movements
	that purport to "get equality" for some group or another,
	it would pay well to examine what equality <em>exactly</em> they are gunning for.
</p>
<p>
	This is unsurprisingly not without issue;
	most people's reaction when I come asking questions with regards to this sort of thing
	react with dismissal, confusion or outright hostility;
	I have been told that you should not – <em>must not</em> – think about this too hard
	if I were to value societal credence and status.
	This is such a surprising reaction:
	one would think that something as globally important to one's worldview as "equality"
	would merit greater scrutiny and have a much more robust case for it
	than something like a movie or a book,
	but it seems like certain examples of the latter can have arguments for or against it
	being promoted much more vigourously than that of campaigning for equality,
	whose support generally falls into the "if you don't follow us you are evil"
	type of religious argumentation.
	This is all very important motivation for the below proposals of what equality is,
	and what people want out of it.
</p>
<h1>Initial Proposals</h1>
<p>
	There are a truly bewildering amount of ways you can define when two things are equal,
	and it would not be possible to list them all,
	simply because any two-bit actor can go ahead and create a new one,
	as alluded to above.
	Nevertheless, let's look at some proposals of equality
	that don't particularly apply themselves to humans first,
	so we have an idea of what's going on.
</p>
<h2>Triviality</h2>
<p>
	This definition is not so much a definition as an excuse,
	but believe it or not it's surprisingly prevalent
	(though thankfully, not very!)
</p>
<blockquote>
	<i>(Equality by Vacuous Truth.)</i>
	Two things are equal if <strong>one or both things don't exist</strong>.
	By the principle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous truth</a>,
	any comparison between those two things would be true,
	because the other one does not exist.
</blockquote>
<p>
	This is often expressed as a desire
	to commit genocide or obliteration of one group of humans or another,
	such that one of the groups would have population 0.
	Generally speaking, this isn't quoted directly as a means to create equality
	solely because of the highly technical definition of "truth" in this case,
	but nevertheless it is still very interesting
	to see <em>certain</em> movements for "equality"
	be pushing for such a genocide,
	even if it isn't pushing this definition explicitly or implicitly.
</p>
<h2>Identity</h2>
<p>
	This is the very strict but also very generic version of equality.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<i>(Spacetime Identity.)</i>
	Two things are equal if <strong>they occupy the same space and time</strong>.
</blockquote>
<p>
	There's still a bit of ambiguity in what constitutes a "thing",
	but in general this is still very strict,
	as even the same person who moved five metres to the left 
	would no longer be considered to be "equal" to himself,
	which is patently nonsense to most "ordinary" people.
	As such, there is an alternative, less strict but still just as generic, method:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<i>(Arrangement identity.)</i>
	Two things are equal if
	<strong>
		they are the same collection of atoms, independent of position in space and time.
	</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Which obviously suffers from the Ship of Theseus problem, among other things.
	Applying just a bit of intuition (magic) to it
	would show you that this is also a very strict version of equality
	that would not allow for two <em>different</em> humans to be equal –
	by definition, as the two would have different collections of atoms.
</p>
<p>
	These definitions of equality are used,
	but not in the context of society,
	although arrangement identity is indeed used by real-life people
	to distinguish one person from another.
	Clearly, these definitions are not going to get us anywhere near
	seeing what people mean by "equality",
	even though they are at times very useful,
	for instance, in physical systems.
	Let's make some abstractions.
</p>
<h1>Opportunities and Outcomes</h1>
<p>
	Now that we have seen some toy models of equality,
	let's see some methods that are genuinely used in methods of pushing equality
	that <em>doesn't</em> call for killing everyone on one team.
	We will, however, save the best for last.
</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<blockquote>
	<i>(Equality in Statistics.)</i>
	Two <strong>groups</strong> of humans are equal
	if they <strong>have the same statistics</strong> –
	any quantification between these two groups would yield an equal number,
	as compared via the standard definition of "=" on numbers.
</blockquote>
<p>
	This is demonstrated by how people nowadays 
	always talk about how there should be 1:1:1:…:1 proportions of everything:
	50% men and 50% women in everything from apiarists to zoologists.
	Sometimes this isn't even scaled to population:
	if a group exists, it gets one equal "slice" of things,
	regardless of how many actually belong in the group.
</p>
<p>
	To prove this is true is nice and simple.
	Just get a report or a census,
	and check if every number is equal and sums to 1.
	It is also defensible enough that no one wants to question it,
	for the simple fact that the number 1 is the simplest number
	and therefore passes Occam's Razor.
	However, it is still at least someone contentious,
	due to two simple principles:
	that one can create groups arbitrarily and get extra rights, and
	that one constantly flip-flops as to the position of to normalise or not to normalise by capita.
</p>
<p>
	Or, indeed, that some groups are simply illegitimate –
	but the jury's out as to <em>which</em> one(s).
</p>
<p>Related to this is the idea of foreign ignorance:</p>
<blockquote>
	<i>(Equality by Foreign Ignorance)</i>
	Take a list of everything that both groups have done and ask an alien
	or otherwise ignorant third party to sort them.
	If <strong>the alien cannot sort them any better than random chance would</strong>,
	then the two groups are equal.
</blockquote>
<p>
	Now, to be fair, I have <em>never</em> seen this definition posed that way, 
	but I believe that this is a type of equality that many people tend to push.
	The idea here is that the alien is <em>you</em> –
	<em>you</em> are supposed to not be able to do the sorting.
	A common way of saying this is, to quote some other guy that I have talked to,
	<q>don't let your assumptions colour how you react to others</q>.
	This is a very nice platitude,
	but unfortunately it is very hard for me to parse.
	We'll get to this later.
</p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<blockquote>
	<i>(Equality by Drop-in Replacement)</i>
	Two groups of humans are equal if an individual in group A,
	in an otherwise identical universe, is replaced with a member in group B,
	and if after the individuals die <strong>the two universes remain identical</strong>,
	then the group members are equal.
</blockquote>
<p>
	Originally the "identical" part is to emphasise
	that the two universes should give both members equal amounts of flack,
	but to be fair this is hard to do,
	to say nothing about cloning the universe.
</p>
<p>
	The thrust of this definition is the oft-hailed "equality of opportunity" –
	if society offers everyone equal opportunity,
	then clearly any disparities in the outcome is due to personal issues only,
	and therefore can be explained away.
	While appealing at first, the main problem with using this definition directly
	is that it is simply hard to tell <em>which</em> differences are personal and which aren't –
	there's usually some caveat with this that accounts for, e.g. sexual dimorphism or similar,
	but a full list of such things remain elusive.
	There simply isn't enough time in the world
	to figure out which differences you can safely ignore.
<p>
	The idea of ignorable differences also ties into the idea of foreign ignorance,
	as we will see in a postscript to this article.
</p>
<h1>A Dance of Karma and Utility</h1>
<p>At last, we come to what I believe is the one that humans use the most in this context:</p>
<blockquote>
	<i>(Equality in Karma.)</i>
	Two humans are equal if they <strong>have the same amount of karma</strong> –
	<ul>
		<li>for every moment of joy one has the other must enjoy the same.</li>
		<li>
			alternatively, the above, and also:
			for every tear one sheds the other must shed the same.
		</li>
</blockquote>
<p>
	In the past I have always thought of this as merely what people do in covert form,
	not in overt, direct tones.
	Everyone keeps talking about "equality of opportunity" and some nebulous "justice" so much
	it is very hard for me to think that those constant cries 
	were really just masks to a more basal, selfish thing.
	I've never been the most generous in my life,
	but it's interesting to see similar behaviour being repeated by others.
</p>
<p>
	Nevertheless, when running this whole "what is equal" thing through others,
	I was greeted with this reply:
</p>
<blockquote>
	like, most people have an intrinsic sense of entitlement
	to have the same opportunities other people do <br/>
	if they see other people getting benefits they aren't getting
	and it's not clear to them why this is happening,
	they describe it as 'inequality' <br/>
	and then in order to change this state of affairs
	they form organizations dedicated to, well, changing the state of affairs
	<hr/>
	in this way it's pretty obvious that the appeal to equality
	is more of an appeal to personal desire for experiencing lots of positive-utility things <br/>
	(which was probably evolutionarily beneficial,
	because otherwise you wouldn't be motivated to do things such as hoard food or build harems)
</blockquote>
<p>
	In this way it would seem like the current calls for equality
	is nothing more than a petulant, jealous "if you have it I gotta have it too",
	which ties into the first point of the definition given above:
	<em>all must receive the same number of "happy points"</em>.
</p>
<p>
	Things don't seem to get any better with the addition of the second part either,
	sharing the spills as well as the thrills.
	This is often justified as a way of evening out "historical oppression" –
	"your grandfather kicked my grandfather in the face a hundred and fifty years ago,
	so now I am entitled to kick you in the face just as hard, plus interest."
	Now this is genuinely petty and jealousy at its worst,
	but it was seriously given – I saw once – as a way of achieving equality.
	I should note here that I've seen this part of the definition
	being <em>highly</em> overplayed by critics of it
	rather than by any proponents that I have ever saw however,
	though standard disclaimers about the Internet being an echochamber apply.
</p>
<p>
	I've also been told that <q>one is not entitled to anything</q> –
	which of course makes the above entitlement even pettier.
	However, when this particular subject that I quoted here said that,
	I have a feeling that he hasn't actually thought this through perfectly,
	because it would seem like there are quite a lot of things that one is entitled to –
	it's called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
	which is in this context pretty much "here is a list of demands that society must follow
	as if it is firmly guarded in truth
	(even though it's just a common cash-grab in the name of self-preservation)."
	By no means is the UDHR a bad thing – I'd like to hear <em>that</em> argument –
	but it not being a bad thing shows that one <em>is</em> entitled to something,
	and it's quite a lot of things for that matter.
</p>
<p>
	Overall, whether you are genuinely conflating equality for revenge,
	or if you are adopting a more nuanced work towards some sort of "genuine equality",
	chances are, in concrete actions,
	you want to make sure that if someone gets something that makes him happy,
	then you want <em>everyone</em> to get the same thing –
	which is perfectly encapsulated in the equality in karma thing.
</p>
<h2>Implicatures</h2>
<p>
	The above implies a lot of things,
	and it would pay to list out these implicatures explicitly
	rather than leave readers guessing as to what I actually meant.
</p>
<h3>Demanding equality uses similar tactics to whining</h3>
<p>
	Demanding equality uses the same basic mechanics of the human brain
	as crying about the neighbour next door having a TV and you don't.
	In many ways, this is already known –
	people who disagree with such demands call the demanders "entitled" and similar disparagements.
	It means that if you try hard enough,
	all demands of equality can be seen as petulant whines not worth listening to.
</p>
<p>
	This implies that any distinguishing between stroppily demanding and politely requesting
	is entirely up to the listener,
	and what passes as a reasonable demand for one
	may well be a the cry of a baby to another.
	And just like babies, sometimes the annoying gets so bad
	you don't even want to grant them life.
	Society in general and individual in-groups in particular
	provide guidelines to consider distinctions between entitlement and grievance,
	but it is still pretty much arbitrary what any group
	would classify whatever action as which of the above two groups are.
	And don't forget, as a characteristic of an in-group,
	one group would always like to export their classifications to others,
	hoping to expand their influence.
</p>
<p>
	However, this also means that whining should not be dismissed outright as entitlement,
	but rather as an indicator in inefficiency of delivering happiness to people.
	Because of the intuitive (i.e. utterly mysterious) difference between the two though,
	this would prove hard to do.
	The simplest result would be to examine each claim in the same manner
	(that is, with a common protocol),
	but this may prove difficult due to time and manpower constraints.
</p>
<h3>Equality is arbitrary and "a social construct"</h3>
<p>Several parts to this.</p>
<p>
	First, saying "I am for equality" is about as meaningful as "I like food".
	The prevailing social norms of today mandate everyone to be "for equality",
	just like how in days of yonder you must follow a particular religion
	or eat in a certain manner.
	without further qualifications or definition,
	one can play a little game where you swap any of the above definition between sentences,
	and then there would be confusion to what you actually mean.
	Just as there are many flavours of food,
	there are many ways in which an equality can be found in between any two groups of humans,
	and many other ways in which an equality could have been found in those groups
	but haven't been achieved yet.
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, equality is not a universally guaranteed thing,
	and exist purely in the minds of humans and society.
	Reality, as separate from humans, is under no obligation to be equal in any predicate,
	although humans may attempt to make the world equal as they see fit.
	Indeed, in more liberal places,
	equality might not even be a good thing to certain societies;
	there is an instance of some Pacific civilization extant today whose name I forgot
	who finds "equality" – whatever they may think it is –
	to be insulting when applied to humans.
</p>
<p>
	(There is an additional implicature that there are scenarios
	that equality must be discarded if you call it "just a social construct",
	and that the Pacific civilization mentioned above is one of them.
	This does not seem to be well-received.)
</p>
<h3>Equality movements can do better by laying down on the outset what they mean by equality</h3>
<p>
	Sometimes I get the idea that movements start but don't stop.
	They don't have a specified endpoint that one can evaluate the world to a "yesish" or "noish",
	and if they do when they reach it they start to bloat in scope and grandeur
	until they end up, in effect, "wanting to save the world".
	This is not necessarily a bad thing,
	but they often bring with them baggage from their previous incarnations to the new thing,
	which is suboptimal to say the least.
</p>
<p>
	This behaviour has unfortunately been used already to provide total and permanent employment
	to people who would otherwise not do so.
	The example I am most familiar with is feminism,
	which through "intersectionality" has got its fingers stuck on every pie imaginable
	like the toothpick one tests the fully-bakedness of a pie,
	and the current fashion has them inject feminist thinkings into everything.
	This doesn't have to be a bad thing at all,
	but like any other theory it has to compete with other theories
	and often it dominates everything else
	despite otherwise be a guest in the field.
</p>
<p>
	The main problem with having a set scope to begin with is of course that movements end like that,
	and movements, as mentioned above, don't.
	And of course, movements really aren't under any obligation to end
	with the achievement of a scope,
	but that doesn't mean it's entirely beneficial either.
</p>
<h1>But why? – Motivations towards equality</h1>
<p>
	Equality in today's society is considered to be axiomatic:
	good by default, no further explanation required, and if you ask why, you are evil.
	This is not very good reasoning, and neither is the below attempted justification for equality,
	but something as fundamental a tenet as equality
	should really have some supporting argument for it.
	So this is one that one might find familiar.
</p>
<h2>Why be equal to begin with?</h2>
<p>
	We begin the argument by assuming the opposite, that is, that humans should not be equal
	by any predicate.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		There must then be a pecking (partial) order &lt; that orders humans from best to worst.
		This may be expressed as simply better/worse, or it can be more nuanced,
		such as passing judgement or similar.
	</li>
	<li>Partial orders have maximal elements.</li>
	<li>You should be able to produce a list of such maximal elements.</li>
	<li>You can't.</li>
	<li>We reached a contradiction, and therefore humans should be equal by some predicate.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Though I structured it like a logical argument,
	the argument is mainly emotional in thrust, being essentially,
	"if you aren't equal to everyone else, you might not be at the top!
	How would <em>you</em> feel about that?"
</p>
<p>
	There's otherwise not very much to talk on this matter,
	though frankly I wish there was.
	There's something rather unsatisfactory about this.
</p>
<h2>Why do you have to be so anal-retentive about <em>what</em> type of equality anyway?</h2>
<p>
	When I ask about why equality is important, I get this very strange reply:
	that you shouldn't have to worry about this so much,
	and just "fight for it".
	If I were blithe, I would note how incredibly culty this is, 
	but let's take this a bit further.
</p>
<p>
	What these people are trying to tell me is somewhere along the lines of
	"humans are illgocial,
	so asking more about it is pointless or unproductive."
	Which seems like an odd stance to take
	for something that people spend their whole lives trying to achieve.
	Heck, flawed as it is, the field of theology shows taht when people care,
	they try to make sure they know what they are talking about.
	Whereas with this whole "equality" thing,
	people get strangely capricious about it,
	and there seems to be an undercurrent of
	"you question it, therefore you oppose it, 
	and therefore you are Evil of the Greatest Magnitude Possible
	(variation Seriously Not Even Destroying The Universe Entirely Could Be As Evil As That)".
	Definitely some kind of religious undertones to the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
	All in all, "equality" is one of those words that can easily switch off higher brain functions,
	and it is very clear that it would be optimal to look at it more carefully,
	especially when you realise that you're not working with the same definition as everyone else
	(see above).
	The pressure to simply take it as a semantic given
	and invariant across all time is, however, a great disincentive to do it.
</p>
<h1>Postscripts</h1>
<p>These are going to be short, hopefully. This has taken too long to write.</p>
<h2>"Treatment"</h2>
<p>
	One of the replies that I got with this is that equality is when
	"you treat two (humans) in the same way and not let your assumptions colour your perceptions".
	This is an utterly pointless saying, and here's how:
</p>
<p>
	This is saying, essentially, that the function <code>you.react(subj)</code>
	should not take the properties of <code>subj</code> into account.
	That means that your reaction must be constant – clearly ludicrous –
	or depend solely on environmental inputs
	such as weather, amount of food left for dinner,
	or whether or not you are falling through the sky at a terrifyingly lethal rate.
</p>
<p>
	Of course, I believe that the subject who said this to me
	doesn't really mean it as such –
	I think he is saying something along the lines of this:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>You (U) are speaking to someone else (V). The conversation is logged.</li>
	<li>
		In the middle of the conversation,
		alien group P abducts V and replaces him with a third subject (W).
		U doesn't know.
	</li>
	<li>
		At the end of the conversation, the log is given to alien group Q,
		which is unrelated to P.
	</li>
	<li>
		If Q cannot tell that V and W are different subjects,
		then U is treating V and W equally.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	It has to be said that this is not too controversial,
	but I have issues with this,
	primarily with the nebulous term, "assumptions not colouring your perceptions".
	There are many assumptions one must make in order to even function in an ordinary level –
	to disavow assumptions altogether would be living in solipsism.
	You're just claiming that drawing the line <em>here</em>
	is better than drawing the line <em>there</em>.
</p>
<h2>Equality and Diversity</h2>
<p>
	Depending on which definition of equality one subscribes to,
	equality is either utterly incompatible with 
	or can coexist with "diversity".
	Diversity is one of those other words that people flock to unquestionably
	without thinking about it too much,
	and any other questions about it is also summarily dismissed.
	The arguments for diversity is much more variable and interesting,
	but fortunately there aren't that much different versions of diversity
	that one can surreptitiously refer to
	when talking about some other version.
</p>
<p>
	It is, however, interesting to note that in the most blithe of terms,
	the opposite of diversity is homogeneity, which is when everything is the same.
</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
	All in all, we see that the word "equality" has the mental inhibition ability
	similar to that of a drug;
	people take it unquestionably and as a semantic given
	when no such basis can be found in reality, at least not easily
	(we have given some possible results in this article).
	Going forward, we might want to rethink what 
	we want equality, whatever it may be, to mean.
