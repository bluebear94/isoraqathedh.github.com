...

In the barely illuminated, windowless room, nine men sat in their chairs.
The chairs all faced a round table,
and on it were several sheets of papers.
Some of them were letters, others reports.
There was not a sound
as the nine men quietly deliberate with each other and themselves.

The "discussion", to the impossibly lucky outsider who can see this,
may only look like an impressive beard-twirling competition,
but it was more than that;
this chamber is the very one that determines the future of the nation,
where important decisions are made and broken.
Today, however, this venerable group of nine had the most unenviable task
of deciding on *the* most important decision the century has to offer,
one that would affect the daily goings of everyone in the kingdom,
from the lowly baker making his loaves
to the queen herself in deciding her taxes for the year.
Many petitions were made and even more letters solicited,
and endless amounts of money have been traded back and forth
in hopes of influencing the result somehow.
All that, just for this.

One of the nine stood up and gestured that he wishes for a small break.
He glided slowly to a nondescript part of the wall, stood there for a while,
and then slowly faded away from view.
The sheets of paper were shuffled around after he left,
and the beards are moving in new and exciting directions
that would never be seen outside of this room.
Small visions popped out of the centre of the table.
A couple of concerned faces were visible
and though not a sound was made
the nine men seem to have understood the frenzied figure entirely.
With one twitch the vision was dismissed,
and the next one brought in.

After repeating this for more than a handful of time,
the missing man materialised and returned to his seat.
The discussion may begin again.

---

The beards stopped twitching, perhaps out of tiredness.
After an indefinite amount of time where nothing visible seems to have happened,
not even a drop of a steel ball or a slightest gust of wind,
the men slowly stood up, and said the first words in this room
for the half a day they have been stuck in there.

One: "The Unready have been using this new technology for several years now,
and with our increasing trade and their increasing coöperation
it seems impossible to keep them from using it.
With no other available option,
it seems like the only way to ensure our continued existence
is to adopt their custom, though the change may be painful at first.
I vote **yes**."

Two: "This 'technology' is yet a century old,
and although it has taken the Unready by the millions
it is to our standards still immature and untested.
Why risk potential lives and waste definite time and money
adopting this pointless system
if the one we are using right now is perfectly functional and productive?
I vote **no** to this proposition."

Three: "A tree that bends to the slightest breeze will make no good wood,
and we should not bend to the whims of the many even though they may *be* many.
We are an ancient and venerable nation,
and the way we do things – our custom – reflects this.
To change such a fundamental part of our civilisation,
one that affects every single walk of life,
to conform to those who we name 'Unready', is beyond preposterous.
I vote **no** to this proposition."

Four: "The new system promises and demonstrates incredible simplicity.
Even if it was created by the Unready,
there is a quality built into it that is entirely independent of this fact.
It can be used to simply the efforts of our spell-finders,
and wand-makers can use this opportunity to build common ground above it all.
The interoperability that comes with adopting this new technology for all
is impossible to ignore.
This is why I vote **yes**."

Five: "Even if millions of the Unready may use it,
still many millions do not.
Those who live in the islands to the north,
and those who live far across the ocean to the west:
not only do they not use this new system,
our growth and existence depends on them more than the others.
We share the same roots as them,
so it only stands to reason that we don't attempt to arbitrarily break roots.
So, despite the many wonders that this new technology promises
I can only say **no**."

Six: "Under my jurisdiction, I have seen many things.
Many *thousands* of things, all done in the current way.
We have many benefits in keeping things that way,
to ensure that our ideas remain pure throughout.
After all, what if the Unready roll out a newer, better system later?
We can't afford to keep changing for them all the time.
I *vehemently* say **no** to this impossible challenge."

Seven: "We are not as numerous as the Unready,
and we are much better prepared to take on this problem than them.
Unlike our colleague's insistence that it is the mere chasing of a dragon
or the detestable gold of a vandal,
making such a change is far easier to us than it is to them,
and we can have many quick returns
while skipping the pains and challenges that the Unready must face.
If one day we must reveal ourselves,
then it would be best to not look like backwards barbarians while doing it.
I say **yes** to it."

Eight: "Thousands of men working together towards homogenisation?
Everyone being able to speak a common language,
one whose divisions of reality is far more sensible
than the grotesque agglomeration we have today?
How can we ever refuse such a glorious proposal? I vote **yes**."

Silence.

Four votes to four. It was up to Nine to make the final decision.
He sat down while the rest were still standing,
and let time pass for several more minutes.
Somehow, with no communication, the room was a lot more eerie.

More silence. Then, finally, a single word:

Nine: "**Yes**."

And with that, the Interdiction of Metric of 1894 was passed,
imploring the kingdom to change to using the System of Tens
before the next decade is through.

It gets a little bit busy in the Grand Market sometimes,
but rarely has the place been as crowded as it was now.
Sadly for the shops that surround the Market though,
it was not for them that the line was formed,
as its destination was an imposing castle far from the market,
complete with dark clouds and flashing lightning.

"So," asked the melon shopkeeper,
"how's that whole metric system going on for you?"

"What do you mean?" asked the candlewood merchant.

"Well, you've heard the decree.
Everything has to be in metric before ten years have passed.
That probably means your stuff."

"Well I haven't actually thought of doing it soon.
It's actually slightly more complicated than what you might think."

"Oh? What do you mean by that?"

"Tell me, as someone who sells melons, what do you have to do?"

"Well, all I *had* to do was to replace the scales
with ones that measure in kilograms,
and also recalculate the prices.
Admittedly some customers have been accusing me of ripping them off –
you know, 'oi, this used to be fifteen shillings per pound,
but now it's thirty-five shillings per kilogram!
That is a complete travesty and I will report you!'
But really it's nothing beyond what I usually get
from regular price increases."

"You're pretty lucky that's all you got,
but while I haven't got much in the way of rip-off accusations,
sourcing new material is significantly more difficult."

"If you don't have the customers hounding at you,
then your life can't be *that* bad."

"That's what you'd think, but life just refuses to be that easy.
You know how much work turns a raw candlewood stick into a real wand?"

"Quite a bit, I would think, but none of it would be done by you,
considering you're just the *retailer*."

A raised eyebrow from the candlewood man. "Making a wand is *hard*.
You, a mere *retailer* of melons, probably won't know this,
but there are far more considerations to a wand than merely its weight.
Its length, wand cores and so on – those all require measurements,
and they all interrelate with each other.

"So when you get moved from 12-inch wands to 30-centimetre ones,
everything changes ever so slightly.
The wand cores, be they wood or feather,
they have to be adjusted a little to ensure the spell goes through right,
and of course if you had the candlewood a little to thick around the core
the spell fizzles out for completely mysterious reasons,
or it gets aimed in an unexpected direction, and all that mess.
It's therefore extremely hard to 'merely' add an extra point or two
up a wand, and that's why that giant line is there –
to have everyone's wands inspected and standardised."

"Surely that means more business for you?"

"You're partially right,
but the government want to develop
some special wand-growing and -shrinking technology
which would largely take the job out of me.
Why do you think the line is going towards the castle and not me?"
