<p>With groups come identification of groups, and with that come a class of objects termed <dfn>graphical group identification device</dfn> must be created. In the lands and countries of the J.-Pasaru, this device is called an <dfn>ovecs</dfn> /oʊ.vɛks/ (plural: ovexes /oʊ.vɛks.əs/, E.-Pasaru: žtlĭm /ʒt.lɨm/). This document describes what an ovecs is, how it is used, how one is made, and how it is different from an Earthling flag (and how similar the two can be sometimes).</p>

<p>An ovecs is a graphical group identification device that is primarily distinguished by the following parts, ordered by distinctiveness:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The primary board, noticeably octagonal, called a <dfn>banner</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: sen). Apart from its interesting eight-sided shape, it is also the largest part of the ovecs. The word “sen” in colloquial contexts can also refer to the entire flag, but in specialist speech is only ever referring to this board.</li>
<li>The <dfn>legend</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: üjebraot), a rectangular board with some letters written on it. There are some rules regarding what can be written on the board, but while it is separate from the banner, it is an <em>essential and integral</em> part of the ovecs and cannot be removed without justification or context.</li>
<li>Zero or more <dfn>plates</dfn> (E.-Pasaru dulĭť), each of which represent a number or a numeral. These hexagonal plates, despite appearing between the banner and the legend when used, are <em>ancillary</em> data to the original flag, and addition or removal of a plate assembly does not change the meaning of the flag appreciably, politically speaking. However, it does contain important information with regards to succession.</li>
<li>Last but not least is the <dfn>pole</dfn> (E.-Pasaru lëdæn), which is a vertical bar that supports the entire assembly at its centre. While it might seem to be a trifling detail to indicate that the pole is at its centre, this is in fact a very important part of what makes an ovecs an ovecs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Three of those four items are indicated in the example ovecs as seen on the right. (There are actually <em>real</em> example ovexes as there are provisions to reserve some designs specifically for documentation purposes, but that’s for later.) But first, let’s go through each component in turn.</p>
<h2 id="the-banner">The Banner</h2>
<p>The banner is the most important part of an ovecs, so most would be forgiven for saying that it is the <em>only</em> part that matters. While it has many things in common with the face of an ordinary Earthling flag, it fulfils a slightly different corner of identification phase space.</p>
<h3 id="names">Names</h3>
<p>The banner is always an octagon with internal angles of 135°, and each corner and side has different names. A corner is called a <em>pœ</em>, and the edges are called <em>naon</em>.</p>

<p>The long names are all descriptive – <em>naonü̲jbŕeyaot</em> is on the side of the legend, hence its name. The short names on the other hand are all named after units: the corners are the names of the Eight Leaders that have rescued the nation of Vohalyo from its near death in the year −40 PD, and the eight sides are named after their first eight descendants. Additionally, the central point also gets a name, <em>cŕeďnzatť</em>, and the names of the sides can also refer to the midpoints of those sides, if one explicitly prefixes either name with the word <em>pœ</em>.</p>
<h3 id="contents">Contents</h3>
<p>So what does one do with the banner? Draw on it, of course.</p>
<p>Specifically, to make a flag there are three main parts: lines, colour and devices. Lines and colour complement each other, and devices sit atop of them.</p>
<p><strong>Lines</strong> (<strong>Tšop</strong>, or <strong>Pallo</strong> in informal contexts) cut up the banner’s surface into a finite number of regions. Although lines in most flags are straight, they are allowed to be curved, as long as areas cut up by the lines are all simply connected and there is an area δa &gt; 0 that is less than all the areas of the region (the Rule of Non-Infinitesimals: no cutting up the name surface into any number of infinitely small areas.) The value of δa is sometimes set by flag manufacturers explicitly.</p>
<p>Lines are defined by their origin and destination points, which start off from the seventeen origin points defined for every flag (the eight corners, the eight midpoints and the centre). New points can be declared as the intersection of two lines, or from sliding an existing point along a previously defined line. Although curved lines are allowed, they are defined largely informally, usually by saying that they go across the point “in the wrong direction by some distance”.</p>
<p>Once all the lines are defined, the colours are placed in. They are usually only defined as basic colour terms: “red”, “green”, &amp;c. They also obey a much looser version of the rule of tincture: “metals” now include such colours as sky and lime, and merely indicate that the colour is “high luminosity”. Additionally there are some colours that have medium luminosity, which can coëxist with both metals and colours (low intensity colours).</p>
<p>Then, on top of it, come the devices, which is just an arbitrary figure. They do not obey even the relaxed rule of tincture, and can be any shape, size and number, but still obey the Rule of Non-Infinitesimals. They all have one anchor point or two bonding points that is used to define the device’s position and orientation.</p>
<!-- To do: draw a figure indicating how bondings and anchors work. -->
<h2 id="the-legend">The Legend</h2>
<p>Below the banner is a rectangular board.</p>
<h2 id="plates">Plates</h2>
<figure>
<img src="img/digits.png" alt="The twelve plates in the Standard Set. They represent the digits 1 to 12 (0), in ascending order from top to bottom, left to right." /><figcaption>The twelve plates in the Standard Set. They represent the digits 1 to 12 (0), in ascending order from top to bottom, left to right.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Between the legend or the plates are zero or more hexagonal plates, known simply as <strong>plates</strong> (EP: <strong>dulĭť</strong>). They are ciphers, in the sense that each one encodes a digit, though they historically encoded an entire integer. They are nonessential, which means that they can be discarded if space requires it.</p>
<p>The number that they encode is the flag’s <strong>succession index</strong>. When a country has a change in leadership, either by hereditary succession or by election, the flag is updated to reflect this change in leadership in a process named <strong>succession</strong>. This is done by simply incrementing the number written on the plate by 1.</p>
<p>Because of their nonessentiality, they are also largely unstandardised on an international level, which means that different vexillological unions, named <strong>pacts</strong> (AOďwāg), can have different digits. The picture indicated above – that of the Standard – is adapted as the international standards for any new pacts, but existing ones can continue to use their own set if need be. This is also a factor in explaining why the standard set has irregular behaviour for the digits 9 through 0 (12) – it was adapted as a combination of the most popular ones, and the combination just so happens to make sense in its historical content. Specifically, the figures are assigned by adding more to the previous one, but their position is based on defining a final symbol and working backward.</p>
<p>The existence of pacts also help in keeping the number small; this is done in two ways. First, unless there is only one country in a pact, there must always be a country in a pact that has the smallest succession index (either 0 or 1). If there is no such country, then 1 is subtracted from all members’ succession index until one of them hits the minimum. This is called <strong>snapback</strong> (<strong>nŕaoj</strong>) and happens automatically. The other more drastic measure is to simply declare unanimously that the successor index is to be reset to 0 at the beginning of some year for all members that did not receive an exemption.</p>
<p>Plates are useful in indicating the change in leadership of a particular country and are used extensively in historical maps where an increase in the succession index is a handy representation of change of leadership. However in the wild plates are much rarer and usually only appear in the homes or graves of current and former leaders of any type. They are, however, permitted to be attached to any flag provided that the correct succession index is used.</p>
