<p>On the 288th day, 11523, a brand new project, almost ten years in the making, was published. The work was called <em>The Tale of Bigencenryin</em>, and it was Pasaru’s first comic book series. This was a highly controversial series as well, because it has always been intended to be an experiment in literature most radical. The great experiment was to introduce a brand new element in literature that no one before thought was possible to be written into a story: the idea of a character.</p>
<p>Although it seems rather silly to Earthlings, and most can scarcely believe such a central concept of a story can be absent for so long in the development of a civilised society, this is not really so much of a surprise once the observer learns about the context surrounding stories in Pasaru. The full story of stories starts from the very beginning of civilisation itself, wending its way through religion, referendums and treatises, but first, a little background on the world of Bigencenryin itself, as is tradition.</p>
<h1 id="contents">Contents</h1>
<p>Like many franchises at the time, Bigencenryin is built mainly to please the authors and secondly to make a good and simple puzzle for the readers to think over. This means that not only is the content more in-depth than what Earthlings would have been used to, it also reads more like a textbook than a story. (More on this later.) Content-wise though, <em>Bigencenryin</em> and later its accompanying franchise is pretty bog-standard. As such, it gives an excellent opportunity to examine what a typical story in Pasaru looks like.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-beginning-there-was-onicleu.">In the beginning, there was Onicleu.</h2>
<p>And not long after, there was no longer Onicleu. It suffered a catastrophic failure, scattering its inhabitants far and wide.</p>
<p>That sounds a little bit of a depressing start to what is ultimately a pretty light-hearted series of <em>comic</em> books, so let’s back up a little.</p>
<p><strong>Onicleu</strong> is (or was) your bog-standard planet, although at first glance to an Earthling’s eyes it may not look like that: it’s hot, it’s dry, whatever seas it has is brackish and lifeless, everything is in a none-too-pleasant shade of brown, the gravity is chokingly high, the air is thin and only breathable in the vaguest of terms, and above all it takes twenty minutes longer to make an ice cream than usual. As such, its inhabitants are noticeably much rougher and tougher, with all the ordinary trappings of evolution that allow them to survive in such a hostile planet. Noticeably the stronger gravity makes jumps a lot stronger, and the dominant species – <strong>buminredexu</strong> – even has a few proto-wings to help with that.</p>
<p>For however hostile the planet was to conventional life, however, buminredexu have made out of it quite well. They have had made a global civilisation with much contact between each of the nations, an excellent road, air and rail network, and even a mature space program that is capable of moving around the solar system and even do mining trips around it to boost Onicleu’s ailing resources. For the most part, all was well with the civilisation that buminrede have wrought.</p>
<p>Of course, as the reader undoubtedly knows, this did not last too long.</p>
<p><strong>Those Who Are</strong> (blunhexu dlimen) are a mysterious force of nature that causes things to happen. The identity of Those Who Are are unknown to both Bigencenryin and Onicleu, but the reader and author both know that they are an indeterminate number of warring civilisations, whose battles tend to step over the recently-born civilisations of the world. They live, essentially, one layer of meta away from the story of <em>Bigencenryin</em>, and in the work itself they are treated as essentially a random event generator.</p>
<p>The reason why we bring up Those Who Are is that they are the ones who disrupted Onicleu’s existence. Some war or another caused, by means of a ludicrously-sized missile, to input the requisite 10<sup>33</sup> J of energy required to overcome the gravitational binding of Onicleu. The missile was slow enough to allow early detection and evacuation, but not slow enough to allow research and development to actually stop it. So in the end, although casualties are low, the home planet was lost – absolutely.</p>
<p>In that moment of chaos, here were several ways out of the planet: firstly, you could run away to another planet in the system, but carrying capacity was (and to some extent still is) low and the they got overran fairly quickly. The second, and only other way, was to go through a highly experimental system that launched a capsule containing a family-sized crew somewhere at random at a ludicrous speed. This method was the method of escape to the gang that will later be known as the Zencuru Ulibeme.</p>
<h2 id="arrival-in-bigencenryin">Arrival in Bigencenryin</h2>
<p>150 years later, Bigencenryin first noticed a strange brightening of the sky where Onicleu once was. It was like nothing they have ever seen before, and it corresponded to no known natural phenomenon, for reasons obvious to us but not them. Many found this unusual, but not particularly noteworthy, so life went on as usual, although maybe this time with a few more conspiracy theories than usual.</p>
<p>It did not take long for things to get wonky again. Two years later, that same spot started to get brighter again, and this time with a <em>very</em> noticeably blue tint to it. The light got brighter and brighter. This time the conspiracy theories <em>really</em> got underway, as did the various prophecies of the end of the world. As the months ticked by, the light got brighter and brighter, and it was clearer and clearer that whatever it was, it was moving right toward the planet.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>Seven years later, late at night (as it always was) it landed in a remote field in the country of Bigencenryin,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> slowing down enough so that its crew can survive and that it does not turn itself into a missile. Landing within eyeshot of the most rural motorway in the island however means that they took several hours to be spotted, but when they were the response was quick. Risking the suicide cults, the terrorist attacks and the rampant sports commentators raising into a fever pitch in a situation already destabilised by the strange new star, the government announced that a hitherto unknown species of intelligent being had landed between J3 and J4 of the 3B corridor motorway.</p>
<h2 id="ascension-into-crime-fighting-and-no-small-amount-of-friction">Ascension into crime-fighting and no small amount of friction</h2>
<p>After the usual pleasantries – “how are you”, “where do you come from”, “where are you going”, “why do you have so strong a pair of legs”, “do you like these fried noodles with slow-fired *pork” and so on – the immigrants slowly integrated into society. However, being starkly different from the rest of the population in such radical ways that they require such things as a pressure chambers for their homes, a personal trainer for an exercise regime, drafting up new flyways and other accessibility plans to help with their newfound flying abilities, and a couple of hastily-added kludges to the filing and census system, a lot of R&amp;D needs to be done to accommodate them. That had made quite an impact to the economy, which promises quite a lot of return as it needs to keep up with the inevitable burgeoning of the population. It’s all good economic sense, and the nation soared in its businesses and finances as a result.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the resources expended for all of the two or three hundred buminredexu might start looking like a little bit too much to your average citizen at the time. Some buminredexu think that they’re being patronised and some even think they’re to be treated much better because they have the power of flight and their hosts do not. This undertone of hate and fear simmered for a few months, and eventually came to a violent end in the course of over a week.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, what happened was that each species developed fringes. The first fringe that came out is the group that wanted the aliens out. This in turn sparked a counter-group that more or less wiped them out, but then <em>didn’t</em> stop, and this group is later known as the super-villains. In response another group of biminrdexu banded together with the local law enforcement to help not to become what is eventually called the Zencuru Ulibeme Uligre – the Allies (and Only the Allies) of Zencuru. (The position of Zencuru’s name in the name of the group is unusual, because most of the time group names have little to do with the names of its constituents. We’ll get to that later.)</p>
<h2 id="equilibrium">Equilibrium</h2>
<p>Eventually, the situation slowly settles down into an uneasy but stable state, a state where many people still hate many other people and there are the occasional battles here and there but overall no one is hurt too badly for anyone to care and it just goes on like an interesting study in chaos theory.</p>
<p>Of course, just because not too many was seriously hurt by this doesn’t mean that <em>no one</em> was seriously hurt, and the infrastructure <em>definitely</em> took a hit over all the overpowered fighting that goes on. That gets rolled into the maintenance costs, and while the entire situation looks very much like a broken window fallacy deal, It did over the years spur on the development of stronger materials that can resist the scary damage that the buminredexu can output. Even so the sign that many motorists in Bigencenryin fear is the dreaded <em>zencuru lenigime</em> sign – “avoiding superheroes”, but more technically the battles they have and the damage they make.</p>
<p>And so, life goes on, and the bulk of the backstory ends here. There are some more history that goes on later, but this is the main backdrop behind which many of the comic books start on.</p>
<h1 id="publication-background">Publication background</h1>
<p>Though the idea of a character seems to most of us as fairly straightforward, but as so it turns out this is not the case in Pasaru. In fact, before the publication of <em>Bigencenryin</em>, the world of literature has never once heard of this seemingly basic idea.</p>
<p>The literature history of Pasaru at the time is much more mature than the paragraph above gives it credit for. There had been many stories written before <em>Bigencenryin</em> and after it, and there are literary giants, scourges, unspoken rules and de facto standards, just like the literature we know here and now. The key difference here is that due to a severe difference in psychology, the internal valuation of a single individual who lives in this land, the kilis, is much less than the average inhabitant back on Earth, the humans. In general, this makes individual much less receptive to hearing the thrills and spills of others, especially if it is presented as a deliberate lie, which is of course what fiction is. So the individual has never arisen over the natural development of literature, which was the time when people don’t think above one level of meta and things were mostly devoid of feedback loops. We can go on forever about this, but it would take several thousand more words to explain fully the ramifications of the different psychologies that exist between the kilis and the humans.</p>
<h2 id="the-story-of-fiction">The Story of fiction</h2>
<p>In the beginning the only usage of language was to facilitate survival. this is awfully dreadful and boring, so in time people divided the use of language into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing to help survive the outside world;</li>
<li>Writing to help survive with others; and</li>
<li>Writing to help understand oneself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fiction grew out of the last of these, but not before a strange precursor: religion.</p>
<h3 id="religious-undertones">Religious undertones</h3>
<p>In retrospect this isn’t particularly surprising, considering that the whole idea of understanding oneself has a very deep connection with understanding one’s place in the world. In particular, how one comes to be, continues to be, and ceases to be. This is the perfect job for religion, at least as a first-order approximation.</p>
<p>Later developments demonstrate just how different these beasts are from humans. For instance, for the most part religions started out as being just-so stories, (and sometimes <em>morally charged</em> just-so stories, graduating to <em>viral it’d-be-a-shame-if-you-don’t-believe</em> stories at that) but later on someone had the brilliant idea of starting a religion that tells no lies by telling its believers absolutely nothing that it doesn’t know for sure. Others, realising that their stories wrote themselves into a corner, pulled a mulligan, decided that their stories don’t describe reality anymore, and said it outright to their followers. From the former group arose science and all its wonders, and from the latter group fiction arose.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The earliest fictions really showed their (classically) religious ancestry by having a plot which involves a bunch of overpowered men running the show – a show that is in fact Pasaru, the world that the authors live in. These are very close to the Earthling conception of a god or a pantheon of gods but even then it was very clear that it’s not so much a pantheon as an entire city, or country, or even a whole planet – “other world” – of them running around meddling with Pasaru’s business. From there a little bit of random drift and a little bit of creative input from the descriptivist religions either whittled them away to nothingness or made them multiply into mundaneness.</p>
<p>Soon the proto-fictions/post-religions, otherwise named <strong>irrealis religions</strong>, proliferated and became more or less became the bread and butter of the world. However, although they sound a lot like modern fiction and for the most part can be read today as such, their religious heritage makes them markedly not so in their historical context. For instance, they are all that special type of religions that does not accept the existence of other religions, so readers of one story-or-religion only ever read <em>that</em> story-or-religion, and no others.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> And further to it is that they tend to have mysterious origins, with most of them having no author and the rest claiming to be “divinely inspired” rather than just being “written” by someone. Some of these properties will endure, and others won’t.</p>
<h3 id="i-in-the-mirror">I, in the mirror</h3>
<p>In the year +500, self-awareness started getting really meta in an event that sounded really goofy to most Earthlings, and the men of Pasaru started to delve into the wonderful world of feedback loops, people started analysing how literature was done by the ancients, and wondered about how they can use this to make better books. “Books”, or “stories”, in our case, to them, always meant creating an alternate reality that would pass some level of scrutiny by the reader. In fact, the reader has always had to take a much more active role in storytelling than on Earth; the philosophy is that while a story can be all within the mind of one, for the most part it would greatly benefit from collaboration and peer feedback.</p>
<p>A hundred years later the first treatise of fiction, simply titled <em>Fiction</em>, was published, outlining all of the properties of fiction mentioned above and marking the time when fiction and religion finally went their separate ways. Books started to proliferate in ways that has never been seen before, and increasingly authors own up to being authors of the story instead of claiming divine inspiration.</p>
<p>As mentioned before however, fiction never really became fiction as we know it because of its religious heritage, and one of the most important differences is that the closest equivalent to the character before Zencuru is a group of units with relatively little differentiation between individuals. This comes from the concept of pantheons, but rather than on Earth where pantheons in Western civilisations dwindle away to monotheism, in this case the pantheon dwindled away into infinity as members of a Star Race.</p>
<h2 id="a-matter-of-emergence">A matter of emergence</h2>
<p>The beginnings of religion in Pasaru made it so that they are mostly polytheistic in nature, and from what we have learnt earlier about the history of fiction one immediately sees that it’s not implausible that characters can possibly <em>not</em> fall out of the equation. In the following sections we track how pantheons slowly gave way to the worlds they live in.</p>
<h3 id="the-star-race-and-its-decline">The Star Race and its decline</h3>
<p>Perhaps one of the few commonalities that all religions share is a pantheon, or a group of men with, essentially, superpowers. As religions slowly became fiction, the going trend is to add more and more of these gods together into the cast until their numbers swelled to that of a fairly large city. From there on it’s clear that this is not so much a pantheon, as a full race of special types. In short, a “star race”, with “star” in the sense of celebrity rather than a big ball of glowing gas.</p>
<p>As society develops in its own idiosyncratic way, people slowly got curious about how the world can possibly empower the Star Race to world-changing proportions. It seems like the species-wide intuition is that it is mostly the environment that shapes the fate of the units, and the choices that the units themselves are largely immaterial. Whether or not this is applicable to the civilisations of Pasaru, the conception makes it so that the stories moves away from what the Star Race has done and toward the world of the Star Race. Therefore, as we go up along history we slowly see the Star Race of each story becoming less and less of a focus, and in their stead is the Star World.</p>
<p>Later on simulation books started to pick up. These books detail the evolution of a world, and its countries (if there is any) and their interactions as a whole. While individuals are mentioned, they are in passing and there is rarely any opportunity to develop them. And so, with these books slowly becoming dominant form, civilisation as a whole avoided character analysis and just had world analysis in its place.</p>
<h3 id="the-world-of-seven-individuals">The World of Seven Individuals</h3>
<p>However, this is not to say that individuals don’t get too much of a focus.</p>
<p>That’s not strictly true, but there <em>had</em> been quiet developments to individual analysis. In particular, there had been exploratory stories – after the treatise – where the “world” is in fact a circle of friends and the story is about how they are affected by outside forces. Further exploratory stories built upon this idea, and soon a small but substantial library exploring the idea of the Roving Band, as the concept is eventually called.</p>
<p>While this group never become very influential in the grand scheme of things, it did set the stage, and formed the inspiration of the final publication and creation of <em>Bigencenryin</em>.</p>
<!--
## The night before, metaphorically speaking ##
For prosaic reasons most of the things in _Bigencenryin_
that isn't directly related to its format or its characters
are fairly typical of its contemporaries.
After all, even though the mind of the average reader in Pasaru
are much more amenable to weird stuff than the typical Earthling might be,
it is still in good spirit of authorship to leave some footholds in the story
for readers to find their bearings in.[^brutal]
As such, many of the things in _Bigencenryin_ are straightforwardly obvious
and reflective of the prevailing trends in literature of its time.

[^brutal]: There's of course alternatives
    for those who really want curveballs to be thrown at them at every turn.
    This is typically the brutalist school of literature
    where the "puzzle" aspect of literature is pushed all the way up.
    The main justification to these
    is that reality is not going to hand you nice neat patterns
    you learnt from the relative predictability of childhood and growing up;
    these books then give an ample challenge
    to those who want to discover the more subtle
    and frequently far less pleasant patterns that the author dreams.

    However, the Brutes' Literature has never been dominant
    throughout the history of literature,
    and therefore _Bigencenryin_ is not written in it.
-->
<h1 id="production-process">Production process</h1>
<p>The creation of <em>Bigencenryin</em> is very representative of the prevailing customs of the time, so it will be very productive to give an account of its creation and at the same time provide insight to the creative process of the citizenry at the time.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<p>A world is hard to make, especially in the modern world where exacting detail is expected from authors. As such, the creator usually enlists helpers or co-authors to help. This means that <em>Bigencenryin</em>, being production-wise very ordinary, has a large team of creators behind it, not unlike how things on Earth are made nowadays by the big companies.</p>
<p>While it would not be very useful to readers to provide the name of the authors, as the average reader of this piece is unlikely to understand the magnitude of his achievements or lack thereof, the organisational structures of the thing is still helpful in order to see how the team is broken up and how they work with each other. It will also be useful to see how these groups come and go across projects. So this section will be about explaining the makeup of the <em>Team Making Bigencenryin</em>, how they work with each other and how they also work on other jobs.</p>
<h3 id="team-breakdown">Team Breakdown</h3>
<p>At the top is the author, otherwise known as the creator, whose name is Luħradnikvut Beȝnrilzis from Jenvad.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Jenvad has been known for quite a few other stories in the past, but they never have gotten much traction from society at large. He made some miscellaneous books, or worlds, all mostly conventional but a little heavy on the illustration side, and a bit light on the tables. He has always resented maths a little as a private prejudice and so have always hired creative teams to help with that, so he has excellent experience in that part.</p>
<p>Below him are the main working groups you would see in any two-bit book-writing programme: a maths group, a timeline group, a national defense and tactics team, the geologists, the biologists, the physicists, the alchemists,<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> really, all the academic fields have some graduates that inevitably band together into these roving teams whose job is to advise authors on writing a world. There’s also artists, choreographers, language technicians and all those good stuff from the arts.</p>
<p>However, one new team is responsible for <em>Bigencenryin</em>, primarily from like-minded peers of Jenvad, is unique to the new comic book: character builders. This particular group works especially closely with Jenvad and in fact is not considered to be a working group but part of the circle of authors; however as multiple authors are not something that is particularly uncommon in the modern writing scene<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> that’s not a thing that would make the book stand out in the end, although it does mean that Jenvad would, unlike earlier books, not be credited directly on the title.</p>
<p>Finally come the messengers who are the ones to relay information between working groups and the author. Jenvad, like most authors, fulfil this role sometimes, but the efforts of a single individual is never enough and others have to be hired. The relationship situation is complicated: some working groups have their own messengers that they keep around with, while other messengers are freelance and not tied to any particular working group. But in the end their job is simple: inform groups, move information, and occasionally act as guinea pigs – playing the role of interesting people lost in the corridor that are quizzed about certain plot points to see if a puzzle is too hard or too easy, and similar situations.</p>
<h3 id="formation-and-communication-of-the-groups">Formation and communication of the groups</h3>
<p>When a book is being created, the author and his circle of friends come around to the jobs board and start hiring Working Groups (and couriers, who don’t count as a working group for some reason) to help make their/his book. This can take some time, and they are usually paid by the hour because working groups, by custom, work multiple jobs in the same period of time. This inevitably results in leakages of data from one story to another, but no one really cares particularly because, as the Grand Ethics Committee put it (although not in the same words), <em>de minimis</em> is a very stiff defense.</p>
<p>With all that said and done <em>Team Making Bigencenryin</em> would have amassed a total of one thousand units, which is by no means an easy amount of subjects to command and coördinate. As such the couriers also play a significant role in communicating and transferring details. Some of the messengers are in fact fully devoted to the project as opposed to only relaying messages back and forth, as is the standard. This ensures that everyone’s roughly on the same page as they proceed. To further affirm that the various details are right, one would also use meetings and a Big Board (later supplemented by computer technology) to ensure that everything is in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>This means that internal consistency is more or less institutionally mandated. However, do not take this as a statement that all stories in Pasaru are well-organised or “plothole-free”, in whatever sense of the word. In the case of <em>Bigencenryin</em>, the well-known and conventional rules of causality is respected and utilised, but in other fictions this is not necessarily the case, and there had been stories that deliberately mess with causality, sometimes even in ways that are not self-consistent.</p>
<h3 id="publication-and-ongoing-work">Publication and Ongoing Work</h3>
<p>In any case, the story is slowly hashed out through these meetings, and slowly the final version takes form and is able to be published. After it has, <em>Team Making Bigenceryin</em> would continue to work on sequels for a while until Open Season is declared (typically within 40 years or so), when what is essentially the analogue to copyright expires and the rest of the population gets to work on the world as well. When that happens however the team still gets to add to the world, but in a reduced capacity as a great deal of work will have been done elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is the fate for Bigencenryin’s publication future at least, but this is not necessarily where all published fictions will end up. For instance, if the story is a one-off then it is possible that total authorial abandonment will come after Open Season, and even the commencement of Open Season can be and often is brought forward by authors wishing to rid their hands of the work. One fate conspicuous by its absence however is that the work would be forgotten. This essentially stopped being an option soon after people started cataloguing and discussing these things en masse, and it is a quirk of the brain of the kilis that anything that is discussed is permanently remembered. This can work to or against the author’s advantage, much like the reverse case…</p>
<h2 id="constructing-the-character">Constructing the character</h2>
<p>A more detailed read of the synopsis of <em>Bigencenryin</em> given <a href="#contents">above</a> would show that at no point were the characters of the story ever explained upon, despite apparently being the novelty part of the story. Partially this is because of force of habit: for the most part such an introduction would suffice when it comes to describing stories. However this being a special kind of story that is specifically about the characters, it would indeed be a mistake not to talk about them at some length. So this section will do so, in the context of their creation.</p>
<h3 id="general-principles">General Principles</h3>
<p>Each individual character is a world of his own.</p>
<p>What this means is that every individual character is understood as a system of related objects working together in vaguely related and possibly random ways. Like a world has its land and its inhabitants, a character has his body and his psyche. Both parts play an important role in determining how the character would respond to situations.</p>
<p>The conceptualisation of a character as a world analogous to a literal world of land and sky makes a large difference to how each character is portrayed. Like Bigencenryin, each character’s thoughts are traced out in excruciating detail – most of the time indicated with decision trees and graphs – and there is an overall unwillingness to take things as granted, so the decisions are revealed very slowly, with a single decision taking up a good few pages to resolve. To the Earthling eye this kind of ultra-low-level thinking process can get a little overwhelming, especially when the process is so detailed that the more major characters have their decision processes and terminal values spelt out explicitly in one of the book’s – <em>comic books</em>, may I add – <em>literal dozens</em> of appendices.</p>
<p>Because the character is a world, little emphasis is put on agency and self-determination; the characters are treated as little more than clockwork automatons that have the appearance of the typical reader but otherwise is completely devoid of personality and can even be considered to be entirely deterministic because of the explicit thinking processes that are outlined in the book. This is however not to say that they are completely logical; Characters are completely capable of violating logic with their principles and may make non-deterministic choices when their terminal values conflict, generating a lot of angst in the process. However, “deterministic-as-default” is the overarching principle.</p>
<p>This “character is world” thought will now be fleshed out with a couple of examples.</p>
<h3 id="zencuru-and-gobidri">Zencuru and Gobidri</h3>
<p>At first, Zencuru was merely the self-styled leader of the Onicleu refugees. Slowly however the story shifts to focus on him more and more and that makes him the protagonist of the story. On the other hand Gobidri was the primary dissenter of Zencuru and therefore makes perfect sense to be the antagonist.</p>
<p>The arrangement of pro- and antagonist is more or less an arbitrary choice made by the author; were he to decide differently – and he well might because this was decided by a coin toss! – Gobidri might end up being the “good guy”. In fact it has to be said that there is nothing in the story that says that either character is good or bad; this is determined in-universe however because Bigencenryin obviously doesn’t like Gobidri’s ideas on how they should be dealt with.</p>

<p>Zencuru and Gobidri are therefore while important in the story strangely interchangeable with each other. But because they are so important, they got the appendices in the book that detail their reactions to every single thought that has or will ever appear in their heads, and in a way it’s not so much Zencuru or Gobidri are <em>actual units</em> but are rather a bunch of algorithms and bodies that synthesise to <em>make up a unit</em>. In the mind of the author, there is no difference between these two things, but Earthlings tend to view units as, well, a unit – indivisible, unanalysable,<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and <em>definitely</em> not made up of an algorithm and a body (at least, not <em>just</em> that). When we talk about Zencuru doing this or Gobidri doing that, what we are really talking of is that the <em>algorithms</em> that hold their name are reacting to this or that (and sometimes the body comes into play as well).</p>
<p>So in the end, who are Zencuru and Gobidri and what are their raisons d’êtres?</p>
<p>Zencuru is the sort-of-protagonist of the entirety of the Z.-Ulibeme, and he was the head of the refugee spaceship, although that doesn’t really mean much. His primary motivation is to adapt to the place and live with the locals, and a couple of his terminal values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued existence of the self, in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>His physical body;</li>
<li>His web of friends-a.k.a.-resource-pools;</li>
<li>More abstractly, his species in general; and</li>
<li>Those who would agree with him, even in specifics</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Care for the environment he lives in, living or otherwise;</li>
<li>Maximally efficient extraction of happiness in the form of:
<ul>
<li>Approval of the environment (viz the inhabitants of Bigencenryin)</li>
<li>Approval from his peers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Being able to fulfil a strong sense of leadership; and</li>
<li>Being able to demonstrate superiority over the environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas Gobidri’s terminal values<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> are closer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued existence of the self, in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>His physical body;</li>
<li>His web of friends-a.k.a.-resource-pools;</li>
<li>His web of those who would agree with him in general;</li>
<li>His species in general</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A return to his home world</li>
<li>An expansion of his fatherland, possibly including Bigencenryin</li>
<li>Deriving joy from the following vectors:
<ul>
<li>Intelligence and efficiency in exploiting the environment</li>
<li>Crafting in all senses of the word</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Being able to explain things, both to himself and to his environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specifics are not particularly important, but what is important is that these things are spelt out in the appendix. Furthermore, the discerning mind can easily see trouble spots where the values conflict with each other. There are reams and reams of this kind of thing, and whenever a major decision needs to be made in the story the decision paths are followed, step by step.</p>

<p>As for the others, a good bulk of them don’t get appendices showing their every thought, at least not at first.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The planet, the country, the island, the city <em>and</em> the language are all called the same thing. This is confusing, but that’s how it worked out.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The fate of religion itself is largely irrelevant after this point, but in summary a significant number of religions went on business as usual until the events following the discovery of self-awareness pressured all but at most six of them into giving up any pretences of being relevant to the world they inhabit and reformed themselves to describe alternate histories (or fan-fiction!) of Pasaru instead. Up until the events of Zencuru they are still immensely popular, though most religious units of Earth would find it almost unrecognisable <em>as</em> a religion, no matter <em>how</em> liberal their ideas may be.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Meanwhile the other branch of religion that split off, named the <strong>descriptivist religions</strong>, only kept the “religion” part of their categorisation for raisins most hysterical, and is essentially protoscience at this point. As such they don’t participate in much of the weirdness that irrealis and classical (<strong>normative</strong>) religions have with each other, and in fact most descriptivist religions slowly became interdependent on each other as they begin their long march toward becoming science.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>The name syntax is the normal one in Pasaru, but it’s not exactly one commonly seen on Earth so here’s a quick primer: “Luħradnikvut” is the “given name” of sorts, “Beȝnrilzis” is the “last name” (which may or may not coïncide with a family name) and “Jenvad” is a “tribe name”, typically a town or city name but not always. If there is a need to abbreviate the name, the <em>tribe name</em> is the one that gets first priority, not the given name as is standard in most Earth places. This also shows that this is an integral part of one’s name and isn’t something optional that speakers add on to differentiate from each other after the first two names.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Read “nutritionists”, because that’s what they are now.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Of course on Earth multiple authors are bread and butter in the non-fiction department, but in Pasaru this is also true for the storybooks as well, and the number of primary authors/idea generators can be frighteningly large. Once an entire family of twenty collaborated together and formed a world exploring the implications of a world where food is evenly distributed not just in transport but in the very soil itself.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>To be fair, few would think that units, viz humans, are unanalysable. What is meant here is that the going theory with human characters is that you can only really analyse them by asking them questions. Here however we take the extra step of composing an algorithm for them and using that to attempt to predict their future movements. Essentially, determinism.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>We’re playing with the terms a little fast and loose here, but essentially these are the things that make the subject happy for no reason other than them having been occurred.<a href="#fnref8">↩</a></p></li>
