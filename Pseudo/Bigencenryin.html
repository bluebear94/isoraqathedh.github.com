<h1 class="title">A Brief History of Bigencenryin</h1>
<h3 class="date">2015-11-01</h3>
</header>
<p>On the 288th day, 11523, a brand new project, almost ten years in the making, was published. The work was called <em>The Tale of Bigencenryin</em>, and it was Pasaru's first comic book series. This was a highly controversial series as well, because it has always been intended to be an experiment in literature most radical. The great experiment was to introduce a brand new element in literature that no one before thought was possible to be written into a story: the idea of a character.</p>
<h1>Contents</h1>
<p>Like many franchises at the time, Bigencenryin is built mainly to please the authors and secondly to make a good and simple puzzle for the readers to think over. This means that not only is the content more in-depth than what Earthlings would have been used to, it also reads more like a textbook than a story. (More on this later.) Content-wise though, <em>Bigencenryin</em> and later its accompanying franchise is pretty bog-standard. As such, it gives an excellent opportunity to examine what a typical story in Pasaru looks like.</p>
<h2>In the beginning, there was Onicleu.</h2>
<p>And not long after, there was no longer Onicleu. It suffered a catastrophic failure, scattering its inhabitants far and wide.</p>
<p>That sounds a little bit of a depressing start to what is ultimately a pretty light-hearted series of <em>comic</em> books, so let's back up a little.</p>
<p><strong>Onicleu</strong> is (or was) your bog-standard planet, although at first glance to an Earthling's eyes it may not look like that: it's hot, it's dry, whatever seas it has is brackish and lifeless, everything is in a none-too-pleasant shade of brown, the gravity is chokingly high, and the air is thin and only breathable in the vaguest of terms. As such, its inhabitants are noticeably much rougher and tougher, with all the ordinary trappings of evolution that allow them to survive in such a hostile planet. Noticeably the stronger gravity makes jumps a lot stronger, and the dominant species – <strong>buminredexu</strong> – even has a few proto-wings to help with that.</p>
<p>For however hostile the planet was to conventional life, however, buminredexu have made out of it quite well. They have had made a global civilisation with much contact between each of the nations, an excellent road, air and rail network, and even a mature space program that is capable of moving around the solar system and even do mining trips around it to boost Onicleu's ailing resources. For the most part, all was well with the civilisation that buminrede have wrought.</p>
<p>Of course, as the reader undoubtedly knows, this did not last too long.</p>
<p><strong>Those Who Are</strong> (blunhexu dlimen) are a mysterious force of nature that causes things to happen. The identity of Those Who Are are unknown to both Bigencenryin and Onicleu, but the reader and author both know that they are an indeterminate number of warring civilisations, whose battles tend to step over the recently-born civilisations of the world. They live, essentially, one layer of meta away from the story of <em>Bigencenryin</em>, and in the work itself they are treated as essentially a random event generator.</p>
<p>The reason why we bring up Those Who Are is that they are the ones who disrupted Onicleu's existence. Some war or another caused, by means of a ludicrously-sized missile, to input the requisite 10<sup>33</sup> J of energy required to overcome the gravitational binding of Onicleu. The missile was slow enough to allow early detection and evacuation, but not slow enough to allow research and development to actually stop it. So in the end, although casualties are low, the home planet was lost – absolutely.</p>
<p>In that moment of chaos, here were several ways out of the planet: firstly, you could run away to another planet in the system, but carrying capacity was (and to some extent still is) low and the they got overran fairly quickly. The second, and only other way, was to go through a highly experimental system that launched a capsule containing a family-sized crew somewhere at random at a ludicrous speed. This method was the method of escape to the gang that will later be known as the Zencuru Ulibeme.</p>
<h2>Arrival in Bigencenryin</h2>
<p>150 years later, Bigencenryin first noticed a strange brightening of the sky where Onicleu once was. It was like nothing they have ever seen before, and it corresponded to no known natural phenomenon, for reasons obvious to us but not them. Many found this unusual, but not particularly noteworthy, so life went on as usual, although maybe this time with a few more conspiracy theories than usual.</p>
<p>It did not take long for things to get wonky again. Two years later, that same spot started to get brighter again, and this time with a <em>very</em> noticeably blue tint to it. The light got brighter and brighter. This time the conspiracy theories <em>really</em> got underway, as did the various prophecies of the end of the world. As the months ticked by, the light got brighter and brighter, and it was clearer and clearer that whatever it was, it was moving right toward the planet.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>Seven years later, late at night (as it always was) it landed in a remote field in the country of Bigencenryin,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> slowing down enough so that its crew can survive and that it does not turn itself into a missile. Landing within eyeshot of the most rural motorway in the island however means that they took several hours to be spotted, but when they were the response was quick. Risking the suicide cults, the terrorist attacks and the rampant sports commentators raising into a fever pitch in a situation already destabilised by the strange new star, the government announced that a hitherto unknown species of intelligent being had landed between J3 and J4 of the 3B corridor motorway.</p>
<h2>Ascension into crime-fighting and no small amount of friction</h2>
<p>After the usual pleasantries – &quot;how are you&quot;, &quot;where do you come from&quot;, &quot;where are you going&quot;, &quot;why do you have so strong a pair of legs&quot;, &quot;do you like these fried noodles with slow-fired *pork&quot; and so on – the immigrants slowly integrated into society. However, being starkly different from the rest of the population in such radical ways that they require such things as a pressure chambers for their homes, a personal trainer for an exercise regime, drafting up new flyways and other accessibility plans to help with their newfound flying abilities, and a couple of hastily-added kludges to the filing and census system, a lot of R&amp;D needs to be done to accommodate them. That had made quite an impact to the economy, which promises quite a lot of return as it needs to keep up with the inevitable burgeoning of the population. It's all good economic sense, and the nation soared in its businesses and finances as a result.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the resources expended for all of the two or three hundred buminredexu might start looking like a little bit too much to your average citizen at the time. Some buminredexu think that they're being patronised and some even think they're to be treated much better because they have the power of flight and their hosts do not. This undertone of hate and fear simmered for a few months, and eventually came to a violent end in the course of over a week.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, what happened was that each species developed fringes. The first fringe that came out is the group that wanted the aliens out. This in turn sparked a counter-group that more or less wiped them out, but then <em>didn't</em> stop, and this group is later known as the super-villains. In response another group of biminrdexu banded together with the local law enforcement to help not to become what is eventually called the Zencuru Ulibeme Uligre – the Allies (and Only the Allies) of Zencuru. (The position of Zencuru's name in the name of the group is unusual, because most of the time group names have little to do with the names of its constituents. We'll get to that later.)</p>
<h2>Equilibrium</h2>
<h1>Publication background</h1>
<p>The literature history of Pasaru at the time is much more mature than the paragraph above gives it credit for. There had been many stories written before <em>Bigencenryin</em> and after it, and there are literary giants, scourges, unspoken rules and de facto standards, just like the literature we know here and now. The key difference here is that due to a severe difference in psychology, the internal valuation of a single individual who lives in this land, the kilis, is much less than the average inhabitant back on Earth, the humans. In general, this makes individual much less receptive to hearing the thrills and spills of others, especially if it is presented as a deliberate lie, which is of course what fiction is. So the individual has never arisen over the natural development of literature, which was the time when people don't think above one level of meta and things were mostly devoid of feedback loops. We can go on forever about this, but it would take several thousand more words to explain fully the ramifications of the different psychologies that exist between the kilis and the humans.</p>
<h2>The Story of fiction</h2>
<p>Over time, as civilisation developed and the men of Pasaru started to delve into the wonderful world of feedback loops, people started analysing how literature was done by the ancients, and wondered about how they can use this to make better books. &quot;Books&quot;, or &quot;stories&quot;, in our case, to them, always meant creating an alternate reality that would pass some level of scrutiny by the reader. In fact, the reader has always had to take a much more active role in storytelling than on Earth; the philosophy is that while a story can be all within the mind of one, for the most part it would greatly benefit from collaboration and peer feedback.</p>
