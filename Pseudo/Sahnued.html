<h1 id="Title">Sánüd</h1>
<p>
	Being a seasoned traveller in the Pseudoan Empire,
	you've taken a liking to metros and other intra-city heavy rail systems.
	Metros are available in every city and they're often completely free,
	though they often vary in form
	from your ordinary "trains on tracks" 
	to the more exotic "teacups on a waterslide"
	or even "a gyroscopic seat stuck in a big pinball".
	Nevertheless they maintain the æsthetic of your average metros:
	thin colourful lines connecting stations far apart together,
	admonishments to mind the gaps, the isolation from the outside world,
	platforms, schedules and of course the fact that you never see a driver – 
	if there are any to begin with.
</p>
<p>
	That driverlessness, apparent or real,
	is a key factor that makes it the very place where the ghostly city of Sánüd appears.
	All you need to do is to get off on the right station and you're there,
	and you won't know until you left the gate.
</p>
<h1>Location</h1>
<p>
	Sánüd doesn't seem to belong anywhere.
	You won't find it on a map of any planet,
	yet it quite clearly has an atmosphere.
	It has a ground and it has a sky, 
	but the sky seems to be constantly shielded by clouds
	and should you dig down far enough you'd eventually find concrete that goes on forever –
	inexplicably.
	Wherever Sánüd is, it's a flat world –
	and I do mean flat as in Aristotlean flat, not just our universe flat:
	there's no curvature.
	Go up to a building and you can theoretically see all the way to infinity.
</p>
<p>
	Despite being in a space all to itself, Sánüd is still easy enough to access,
	supposing you are in a city with a metro system
	that has registered to gain a station to get there.
	All you have to do is to hop in one of those networks
	and ride the right trains.
	You'll know when your next stop is Sánüd;
	the train will always go through some deep forest (for places with lots of large plant life)
	or a strange "ribs-only" tunnel (for places without them)
	and you'll be able to look through the endless forest.
	The obstructing items, be it trees or dust,
	will eventually get closer and closer, and block more and more light,
	until eventually it's dark outside,
	at which point the train will pull in to Sánüd.
	Exiting Sánüd is much the same, except in reverse.
	You can also follow the train tracks on bike or on foot,
	but that's rather dangerous and discouraged.
</p>
<p>
	The actual goings-on from "the train starts entering a deep forest" 
	to "the train enters Sánüd" is a strange business,
	but it generally relates to the fact that you can't see anything outside the train.
	the general idea is that the train
	simply takes a (shockingly literal) turn up away into another spatial dimension,
	and then back out again into another bit of spacetime.
	(think of how a two-dimensional thing going from the first floor of a 3D building
	to the second floor to get an idea of how that works).
	The analogy above explains why you shouldn't really go without a train –
	the train acts as the "elevator",
	a contiguous set of 3D space that does the extradimensional travelling.
	Without that train, you may just end up hitting a dead-end.
</p>
<p>
	But once you get in, there's no way out apart from exactly two places –
	the station you entered Sánüd from, or some other station some distance away.
	The other station usually isn't the same network from the one that you came in from,
	though it's not impossible for it to be the same.
	Every network however has two separate physical stations in Sánüd.
	For instance, the YIRT has two stations;
	one is 23 blocks north and 141 blocks west of the other.
	Other metro networks have stations in Sánüd closer than that distance though.
	There is no "centre" of Sánüd,
	no station that you can count as the origin other than the one you came in from;
	the city is infinite.
</p>
<p>
	Yes, infinite.
	We'll talk about that.
</p>
<h1>Features</h2>
<h2>Infinite size, finite material</h2>
<p>
	An unknowing traveller, on first entry to Sánüd,
	will surely be impressed by its size.
	It does not seem to end;
	thousands and thousands of buildings stretch in every direction
	as far as the eye can see,
	with highways crisscrossing inside and around them.
	So the traveller might think:
		hm, maybe I should go and find its edge!
	And so he walks, on and on.
</p>
<p>
	It won't take long for him to realize that
	it's the same Bėlŕëd Street he's passed by for the sixth time,
	or the fourth time he's seen that highway exit,
	or the fifth that he's passed by that mall that never seemed to have anyone in it.
	In fact, he doesn't seem to meet anyone else;
	it's like the streets of Calgary on a winter's day, only even more desolate
	(Sánüd does have skyways but they're not on such a grand scale as Calgary's;
	even though Sánüd has one that passes right under the bridge of one of the highways.
	So he thinks,
		right then,
		this must be one of those trap cities 
		<a href="http://i.imgur.com/o7GrHZe.jpg">
			that looks like it goes on forever but actually just tiles repeatedly.
		</a>
		No big worry.
	So he walks on, but he starts noting something – he can't make out a pattern.
	Landmarks do predict other landmarks most of the time:
		all Bánget Roads eventually turn into Zpbuut Roads;
		after passing Entrance 08<sub>■</sub>,
		you'll always see Exit 08<sub>■</sub> fifty metres away on 
		60<sup>8</sup>&#x2044;<sub>9</sub><sup>th</sup> street;
		turning left on Keantar Shopping Arcade always lands you on Vndës Road.
	The thing is though, it doesn't seem like it has any large scale pattern.
	Every so often, he passes through a park, and in the middle of the park,
	there's a tiny tablet of four shapes that are laid out like this:
</p>
<table id="dial"><tbody>
	<tr><td class="districtCircle  ">●</td><td class="districtStar    ">★</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="districtDiamond ">◆</td><td class="districtllgram  ">▰</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
	Wherever he goes,
	once he hits such a park there's always this strange 2×2 grid
	placed on a plinth of stone.
	They only ever show these six shapes in these colours,
	with no recognizable pattern to the appearances:
		<span class="districtCircle  ">●</span>,
		<span class="districtllgram  ">▰</span>,
		<span class="districtTriangle">▲</span>,
		<span class="districtSquare  ">■</span>,
		<span class="districtStar    ">★</span> and
		<span class="districtDiamond ">◆</span>.
	A savvy traveller who has been on many such trips in strange dimensions
	would be able to connect all of the above –
		the strange repeats without a pattern,
		the highways that seem to run everywhere yet all look the same,
		the parks every so often,
		the tiles in those parks –
	and figure out the conclusion: Sánüd is an <em>aperiodically</em> tiled city.
	It will repeat forever,
	but its construction will ensure that it would never have a sequence of tiles
	that you can point to and say, "those things will repeat forever in every direction".

		There are six repeating segments of Sánüd that are tiled forever in an aperiodic fashion.
		The coloured lines are the two types of highway in Sánüd that must match,
		and of course the boundaries of the segments must match too.
		These are called "Robinson Tiles".
		Left to right, top to bottom, they are:
			<span class="districtCircle  ">●</span>,
			<span class="districtllgram  ">▰</span>,
			<span class="districtTriangle">▲</span>,
			<span class="districtSquare  ">■</span>,
			<span class="districtStar    ">★</span> and
			<span class="districtDiamond ">◆</span>.
