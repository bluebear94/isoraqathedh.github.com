<h1 id="Title">The Vehicular Gender</h1>
<p>
	Some parts of Egonyota Pasaru change their forms depending on gender. One might not consider 
	this to be particularly special, but one such gender is the well-known Vehicular Gender, which
	is almost entirely unique amongst a large variety of languages (it isn't <em>entirely</em>
	unique of course). What had happened to the language so that it now has this strange feature?
	The answer is that something happened a long time ago to the civilization that hosts them, and
	this particular change is a trivial but useful demonstration to how culture affects language,
	and vice versa…
</p>
<h1>Setting</h1>
<p>
	A long, long time ago, computers were invented. Then, cars were invented. Following that,
	digital computers were invented. The natural progression would be to then put computers onto
	cars. This is all the regular sequence of events that is familiar and perhaps omnipresent in all
	civilizations that will eventually develop into material technology (as opposed to magical 
	technology<a href="#foot1" id="ref1">1</a> or black-box
	technology<a href="#foot2" id="ref2">2</a>).
</p>
<p>
	No matter which track a civilization goes down, as long as there is a need for that civilization
	to interact with other members of that civilization there would be a want for one in an
	appropriate environment to start building machines to emulate members of that 
	civilization<a href="#foot3" id="ref3">3</a> – and this happens to be so for the general
	Pseudoan civilization. A handful thousand years later, the closest equivalent of artificial 
	intelligence in Pseudo was created, and it was pretty much all there.
</p>
<p>
	Then… not much happened. A handful of factors caused this inaction: the proliferation of 
	speculative literature, which embarrassingly drives a lot of legislature and political discourse
	in old Pseudo, has gotten many people scared enough to keep machinery and artificial minds 
	on either side of a large tall wall, and sent many people into theoreticals rather than 
	experimentation. The other, more approachable factor, is the fact that there really isn't any
	need for robots as of then – manual labour plus simple automata are easily managing the problems
	they then face, so there isn't so much a demand for such complex machine. Like a child with 
	everything he wants, the civilization sits there in terms of technological development, focusing
	instead on other things that require more attention.
</p>
<p>
	The whole idea of robots really only took off when the Pseudoans decide to go on long space 
	journeys. Back then, when FTL wasn't (and isn't) a thing that people can do on a daily basis,
	trips even to nearby planets that now take mere hours can take years – Pseudoan years – and 
	staying in a limited space for so long is just silly. Even when the idea of freezing someone
	into a popsicle was put forward, the problem of maintaining the ship against unpredictable 
	factors such as fast-moving bits of debris and subatomic particles with the energy of a thrown
	baseball necessitated the use of things that can intelligently fix the random errors that these
	things make – which is robot-complex.
</p>
<p>
	Like most things it took a long time for the technology to develop at its slow but inexorable
	pace, and eventually the AIs got to the

		<a href="#ref2">↑</a> Black-box technology is a general catch-all terminology for technology
		that uses only naturally-found machine components, and combinations of those components,
		to do the desired work, rather than discovering more basal principles that may expand them.
		Sometimes this is done because the users do not know the inner workings of such components
		(hence the term "black box"), but it may be because of other reasons as well, some of them
		more irrational than others. In any case, the term is only used to describe a technology if
		it wholly depends on only naturally-found machine components – to qualify a civilization to
		be of tech-type black-box technology, <em>all parts</em> of <em>any</em> technology that
