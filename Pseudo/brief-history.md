A Brief History of the Jesdic Pasaru
====================================

The Jesdic Pasaru has a long history behind it,
spanning over one hundred million years,
though a good part of it is rather mindless travelling
from one place to another.
This is a short piece describing its development
from the beginning of civilisation to the present day.

# Part 1: Ordinary Beginnings
The civilisation that eventually banded together to form the J.-Pasaru
is by no means unusual or odd &ndash;
in fact they could be described as eerily humanlike
without much alteration in many respects,
such as language, psychology and especially biology.
This allows us to use more or less homely words and familiar words
to understand and describe their development.

## Setting the stage
In the interests of speed
we shall briefly explain what happened
before the formation of the empire.

In the beginning, (&minus;12,000 PDN or thereabouts)
there was the formation of civilisation.
Then separate countries and kingdoms formed,
and there was war, trade and various related side-effects of civilisation.
For our purposes, not much in the interim matters,
just that by the time &minus;700 PDN rolls around
the stage was set for a fairly large war: the World War.

The War itself is also not very important,
but what happened afterwards is.
The post-War period is called the Restitution,
where there had been various trading of powers and resources
to make the world more homogeneous.
The most important part about it is that not long after,
there was the establishment of a world "government",
though calling it that might not very accurate,
as its power is almost strictly less than that of the United Nations.
Nevertheless, this is the beginning of the J.-Pasaru
as a separate, and later globally encompassing, entity.

## The Stagnation: a gift of introspection
Around the year 563,
something strange happened to the world.
There was a hot new trend
and it's a thought bug that's truly attained viral status
as the entire world has been infected in less than a week's time.
This strange bug is called *self-awareness*.

Being globally self-aware has a handful of side-effects.
Primarily, the pace of technological growth has slowed to a crawl.
Other notable slowdowns include language change and fashion cycles.

This creates a period known as the Stagnation,
as things just simply stop changing much.
However, that doesn't mean nothing's changed;
notably, the species have been a lot more careful,
evaluating new technology before widespread use,
rationing resources at the highest level to individual countries,
and forming a blossoming research community
that looks to why this whole thing began in the first place.
At this point, the empire began to take shape as the top-level management,
leading the way forward in the general direction
but also leaving enough freedom for people to breathe in, somehow.
The situation was not always rosy,
and at times there has been great spats over the distribution issues,
but for the most part things worked out fine.

Twenty or thirty thousand years on,
the empire crawled their way to the space age,
and then a world-changing thing happened.

## Aliens
On Cipog, just three planets out.

This has been a momentous occasion,
and it was enough motivation for the J.-Pasaru
to speed up and attempt to match the alien civilisation
metaphorically down the road, as it were.
With great trepidation they reached out to the aliens,
sending the immortal word:

> Test

Fortunately, that was well-received.
