With groups come identification of groups,
and with that come a class of objects termed
<dfn>graphical group identification device</dfn> must be created.
In the lands and countries of the J.-Pasaru,
this device is called an <dfn>ovecs</dfn> /oʊ.vɛks/
(plural: ovexes /oʊ.vɛks.əs/, E.-Pasaru: žtlĭm /ʒt.lɨm/).
This document describes what an ovecs is, how it is used, how one is made,
and how it is different from an Earthling flag
(and how similar the two can be sometimes).

# Components of an ovecs #

![An example of an ovecs, that of Vohalyo.](img/Vohalyo.png)

An ovecs is a graphical group identification device
that is primarily distinguished by the following parts,
ordered by distinctiveness:

1. The primary board, noticeably octagonal, called a <dfn>banner</dfn>
   (E.-Pasaru: sen). Apart from its interesting eight-sided shape,
   it is also the largest part of the ovecs.
   The word "sen" in colloquial contexts can also refer to the entire flag,
   but in specialist speech is only ever referring to this board.
2. The <dfn>legend</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: üjebraot),
   a rectangular board with some letters written on it.
   There are some rules regarding what can be written on the board,
   but while it is separate from the banner, it is an *essential and integral*
   part of the ovecs and cannot be removed without justification or context.
3. Zero or more <dfn>plates</dfn> (E.-Pasaru dulĭť),
   each of which represent a number or a numeral.
   These hexagonal plates,
   despite appearing between the banner and the legend when used,
   are *ancillary* data to the original flag,
   and addition or removal of a plate assembly
   does not change the meaning of the flag appreciably, politically speaking.
   However, it does contain important information with regards to succession.
4. Last but not least is the <dfn>pole</dfn> (E.-Pasaru lëdæn),
   which is a vertical bar that supports the entire assembly at its centre.
   While it might seem to be a trifling detail
   to indicate that the pole is at its centre,
   this is in fact a very important part of what makes an ovecs an ovecs.

Three of those four items are indicated
in the example ovecs as seen on the right.
(There are actually *real* example ovexes
as there are provisions to reserve some designs
specifically for documentation purposes, but that's for later.)
But first, let's go through each component in turn.

## The Banner ##

The banner is the most important part of an ovecs,
so most would be forgiven for saying that it is the *only* part that matters.
While it has many things in common with the face of an ordinary Earthling flag,
it fulfils a slightly different corner of identification phase space.

### Names ###

The banner is always an octagon with internal angles of 135°,
and each corner and side has different names.
A corner is called a *pœ*, and the edges are called *naon*.

The long names are all descriptive –
*naonü̲jbŕeyaot* is on the side of the legend, hence its name.
The short names on the other hand are all named after units:
the corners are the names of the Eight Leaders
that have rescued the nation of Vohalyo from its near death in the year −40 PD,
and the eight sides are named after their first eight descendants.
Additionally, the central point also gets a name, *cŕeďnzatť*,
and the names of the sides can also refer to the midpoints of those sides,
if one explicitly prefixes either name with the word *pœ*.

### Contents ###

So what does one do with the banner? Draw on it, of course.

Specifically, to make a flag there are three main parts:
lines, colour and devices.
Lines and colour complement each other,
and devices sit atop of them.

**Lines** (**Tšop**, or **Pallo** in informal contexts)
cut up the banner's surface into a finite number of regions.
Although lines in most flags are straight, they are allowed to be curved,
as long as areas cut up by the lines are all simply connected
and there is an area δa > 0 that is less than all the areas of the region
(basically, no cutting up the banner to an infinitely small piece.)
The value of δa is sometimes set by flag manufacturers explicitly.

Lines are defined by their origin and destination points,
which start off from the seventeen origin points defined for every flag
(the eight corners, the eight midpoints and the centre).
New points can be declared as the intersection of two lines,
or from sliding an existing point along a previously defined line.
Although curved lines are allowed, they are defined largely informally,
usually by saying that they go across the point
"in the wrong direction by some distance".

Once all the lines are defined, the colours are placed in.
They are usually only defined as basic colour terms: "red", "green", &c.
They also obey a much looser version of the rule of tincture:
"metals" now include such colours as sky and lime,
and merely indicate that the colour is "high luminosity".
Additionally there are some colours that have medium luminosity.
