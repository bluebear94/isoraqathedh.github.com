With groups come identification of groups,
and with that come a class of objects termed
<dfn>graphical group identification device</dfn> must be created.
In the lands and countries of the J.-Pasaru,
this device is called an <dfn>ovecs</dfn> /oʊ.vɛks/
(plural: ovexes /oʊ.vɛks.əs/, E.-Pasaru: žtlĭm /ʒt.lɨm/).
This document describes what an ovecs is, how it is used, how one is made,
and how it is different from an Earthling flag
(and how similar the two can be sometimes).

# Components of an ovecs #

![An example of an ovecs, that of Vohalyo.](img/Vohalyo.png)

An ovecs is a graphical group identification device
that is primarily distinguished by the following parts,
ordered by distinctiveness:

1. The primary board, noticeably octagonal, called a <dfn>banner</dfn>
   (E.-Pasaru: sen). Apart from its interesting eight-sided shape,
   it is also the largest part of the ovecs.
   The word "sen" in colloquial contexts can also refer to the entire flag,
   but in specialist speech is only ever referring to this board.
2. The <dfn>legend</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: üjebraot),
   a rectangular board with some letters written on it.
   There are some rules regarding what can be written on the board,
   but while it is separate from the banner, it is an *essential and integral*
   part of the ovecs and cannot be removed without justification or context.
3. Zero or more <dfn>plates</dfn> (E.-Pasaru dulĭť),
   each of which represent a number or a numeral.
   These hexagonal plates,
   despite appearing between the banner and the legend when used,
   are *ancillary* data to the original flag,
   and addition or removal of a plate assembly
   does not change the meaning of the flag appreciably, politically speaking.
   However, it does contain important information with regards to succession.
4. Last but not least is the <dfn>pole</dfn> (E.-Pasaru lëdæn),
   which is a vertical bar that supports the entire assembly at its centre.
   While it might seem to be a trifling detail
   to indicate that the pole is at its centre,
   this is in fact a very important part of what makes an ovecs an ovecs.

Three of those four items are indicated
in the example ovecs as seen on the right.
(There are actually *real* example ovexes
as there are provisions to reserve some designs
specifically for documentation purposes, but that's for later.)
But first, let's go through each component in turn.

## The Banner ##

The banner is the most important part of an ovecs,
so most would be forgiven for saying that it is the *only* part that matters.
While it has many things in common with the face of an ordinary Earthling flag,
it fulfils a slightly different corner of identification phase space.

### Names ###

The banner is always an octagon with internal angles of 135°,
and each corner and side has different names.
A corner is called a *pœ*, and the edges are called *naon*.

The long names are all descriptive –
*naonü̲jbŕeyaot* is on the side of the legend, hence its name.
The short names on the other hand are all named after units:
the corners are the names of the Eight Leaders
that have rescued the nation of Vohalyo from its near death in the year −40 PD,
and the eight sides are named after their first eight descendants.
Additionally, the central point also gets a name, *cŕeďnzatť*,
and the names of the sides can also refer to the midpoints of those sides,
if one explicitly prefixes either name with the word *pœ*.

### Contents ###

So what does one do with the banner? Draw on it, of course.

Specifically, to make a flag there are three main parts:
lines, colour and devices.
Lines and colour complement each other,
and devices sit atop of them.

<dfn>Lines</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: tšop, or pallo in informal contexts)
cut up the banner's surface into a finite number of regions.
Although lines in most flags are straight, they are allowed to be curved,
as long as areas cut up by the lines are all simply connected
and there is an area δa > 0 that is less than all the areas of the region
(the Rule of Non-Infinitesimals:
no cutting up the name surface into any number of infinitely small areas.)
The value of δa is sometimes set by flag manufacturers explicitly.

Lines are defined by their origin and destination points,
which start off from the seventeen origin points defined for every flag
(the eight corners, the eight midpoints and the centre).
New points can be declared as the intersection of two lines,
or from sliding an existing point along a previously defined line.
Although curved lines are allowed, they are defined largely informally,
usually by saying that they go across the point
"in the wrong direction by some distance".

Once all the lines are defined, the colours are placed in.
They are usually only defined as basic colour terms: "red", "green", &c.
They also obey a much looser version of the rule of tincture:
"metals" now include such colours as sky and lime,
and merely indicate that the colour is "high luminosity".
Additionally there are some colours that have medium luminosity,
which can coëxist with both metals and colours (low intensity colours).
Furthermore, because of the way the flags are created,
gradients are possible in limited circumstances.

Then, on top of it, come the devices, which is just an arbitrary figure.
They do not obey even the relaxed rule of tincture,
and can be any shape, size and number,
but still obey the Rule of Non-Infinitesimals.
They all have one anchor point or two bonding points
that is used to define the device's position and orientation.

## The Legend ##

<!-- To do: figures? -->

Below the banner is a rectangular board. The board has to be white,
with a black border, and has black text.
The text must have two or more characters in it,
but it must not have an odd glyph length.

The origins of the legend is straightforward.
Too many groups have the same banner design,
so to differentiate a piece of paper with a short code was stuck on.
Eventually this code was formalised and standardised,
and the thing in general is accepted to become part of the flag.
The Rule of Evens was created to ensure an æsthetical balance.

An ovecs can have more than one legend.
This can happen for countries because it is officially bilingual,
or writes in two different scripts in the same language.
Otherwise, it might be because the group it represents has many names
or that the combination of banner and first legend still has a collision.
Legends closer to the banner are considered more important.

## Plates ##

![The twelve plates in the Standard Set. They represent the digits 1 to 12 (0),
in ascending order from top to bottom, left to right.](img/digits.png)

Between the legend or the plates are zero or more hexagonal plates,
known simply as <dfn>plates</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: dulĭť).
They are ciphers, in the sense that each one encodes a digit,
though they historically encoded an entire integer.
They are nonessential,
which means that they can be discarded if space requires it.

The number that they encode is the flag's <dfn>succession index</dfn>.
When a country has a change in leadership,
either by hereditary succession or by election,
the flag is updated to reflect this change in leadership
in a process named <dfn>succession</dfn>.
This is done by simply incrementing the number written on the plate by 1.

Because of their nonessentiality,
they are also largely unstandardised on an international level,
which means that different vexillological unions,
named <dfn>pacts</dfn> (AOďwāg), can have different digits.
The picture indicated above – that of the Standard –
is adapted as the international standards for any new pacts,
but existing ones can continue to use their own set if need be.
This is also a factor in explaining why the standard set has irregular behaviour
for the digits 9 through 0 (12) –
it was adapted as a combination of the most popular ones,
and the combination just so happens to make sense in its historical content.
Specifically, the figures are assigned by adding more to the previous one,
but their position is based on defining a final symbol and working backward.

The existence of pacts also help in keeping the number small;
this is done in two ways.
First, unless there is only one country in a pact,
there must always be a country in a pact that has the smallest succession index
(either 0 or 1).
If there is no such country, then 1 is subtracted
from all members' succession index until one of them hits the minimum.
This is called <dfn>snapback</dfn> (nŕaoj) and happens automatically.
The other more drastic measure is to simply declare unanimously
that the successor index is to be reset to 0 at the beginning of some year
for all members that did not receive an exemption.

Plates are useful in indicating the change in leadership of a particular country
and are used extensively in historical maps
where an increase in the succession index
is a handy representation of change of leadership.
However in the wild plates are much rarer
and usually only appear in the homes or graves
of current and former leaders of any type.
They are, however, permitted to be attached to any flag
provided that the correct succession index is used.

The frequency of snapback largely depends on the values of the pact:
they might desire a large cardinal number to appear on their flags,
in which they will be very rare if present at all;
but other pacts, that prefer the exact opposite,
might snapback a lot, to the point of it being a natural occurrence.
However, no nation desires a *very* large number to show on the flag,
if only for the simple reason that the reader of the flag
will complain about having to process such a large number,
or that too many digits would make the flagpole unnecessarily tall
(a taller flag is harder to see from down below
and is therefore considered less important than a shorter flag.)
Nations deal with this in several ways:

![The standard plate for the relative marker,
to be placed just below the banner.

to indicate a negative relative number.](img/relplate.png)

1. They can simply declare snapback to occur for their entire pact.
   This is easy if they are in their own pact,
   but is rarely done because resetting the succession index to zero
   makes it look like the country has recently underwent a revolution.
2. They can limit succession to be only allowed once a sufficiently long period,
   such as annually or biannually.
   Merely restricting succession to a maximum of twice per year
   brings the number of digits required for the foreseeable future
   to be a reasonable if slightly uncomfortable five digits,
   and the lower the succession rates, the slower digit creep occurs.
3. They can use a special relative plate, as pictured,
   and continually change the number that the relative plate adds.
   This is all but resetting the succession index,
   but with with a special disclaimer about it being "just a trick",
   as it were.

## The Pole ##

The pole is a nonessential part of the flag,
and in fact it is so nonessential
that for the most part the public does not know about it.
Nevertheless, it is still a topic worthy of a brief discussion.

For the most part, flags do not define pole colours,
and they are usually left as the default colour of whatever material
the pole is made of (e.g. brown wood or silver metal.)
When they do, only three *solid* colours can be part of a pole,
and if there's more than one they must be striped.
The directions of the stripes are usually horizontal or vertical,
but can also be in any other direction if it is so warranted.

As mentioned earlier, the pole is not an essential part of the flag.
Like the plate, it can be removed from a depiction of the flag
without changing what it represents,
but unlike the plate it does not have any special meaning
that can be easily generalised to all flags.
This makes them ignored even in places where plates would generally be included,
explaining their general obscurity among the public.

All boards must be centred on the pole.
Furthermore, they must have the same separation,
usually ⁹⁄₁₄₄ of the height of the banners.
The top of the pole must stay between the bottom and the top of the banner.
but where exactly cannot be defined by the flag
and can be wherever is convenient to the flag maker.
They can be fastened in any inconspicuous way as well,
although the majority are done by gluing a handle to the back
that slots into the hole.

# Mounting a flag #

## Simple mounting ##

With a flag being created, all that is left is to put it up somewhere.
The practise of putting up a flag is called <dfn>mounting</dfn>.
There are several conventions for mounting flags,
and those are, with minor variations, uniform across the world,
by chance or by force.

### Fields and their Rings ###

Flags are mounted in a specific area, known as the <dfn>field</dfn> (senp̲arť).
The field may be, but sometimes is not, clearly delimited,
and may be defined in one or both of these two methods:-

1. The field is the area around the centre of the pole
   that is less than a certain distance away from it.
   This distance is approximately two metres,
   but different countries can have different values
   ranging from one to ten metres.
2. The field is the area of the smallest rectangle
   that can cover the area defined by the first definition.

Additionally, there is an additional area known as the <dfn>field's ring</dfn>
(nař ek senp̲arť) that can be any shape or size
as long as it covers all of the field.
The field's ring is invented because the strict definition of the field
makes it hard for architects to plan ahead for them.

There are norms with regards what should and should not be done in the field.
For instance, one should not leave rubbish or other loose objects in it,
and one should not run or unnecessarily disturb things inside it
unless it is to remove rubbish or similar.
Additionally, no object may be taller than the flag in the field,
and there should be an open line of sight from the flag in some direction.
though this is a loose, optional requirement
and in any case the definition of an open line of sight
is a very regional matter.

On the other hand, the field's ring is much more lax
and there are not many rules
that are common to even a majority of all flag protocols.
For the most part, they come in two flavours:
the first is that they are just a random patch of grass,
reserved for the expansion of the field
but as of of yet still open for general use,
or they can be extensions of the field and its rules
to an arbitrary shape and size.
The latter is often seen in places
where the field is nearly or completely enclosed, like a "hole" in a building,
and the former is seen almost everywhere else,
though as always, exceptions exist.

### Poles and Distance ###

The centre of a pole is the nominal location of the flag, that is,
if someone asks for a millimetre-precise location of a flag,
one points to the centre of its (primary) pole.
It is therefore important to keep in track where poles are.

In general, the heights of all poles should be the same in the same field,
although exception may be granted to exactly one pole,
which can be *shorter* than all the others.
That pole, which if present must be at some extreme position of the field,
is the position of honour in which a particularly important flag may be placed,
but which flag this might be is context-dependent
and may not necessarily be the national flag.
In any case, the poles must be at least six times taller
than the size of all the banners,
which are regulated for each flagpole such that each one has the same height.
A popular industry standard is to have them be 533 cm tall – 1 ferā –
and the special pole be ¹¹⁄₁₂ ferā tall.

The minimum separation of each pole
must be at least half the length of the poles,
but cannot exceed three-quarters that length.
For a common layout, where all the poles are lined up straight,
popular standards include ⅝, ⁷⁄₁₂ or ⅔ of the length of the pole.
However, it is not necessary for flagpoles to be lined up like this.
They can be in any configuration as desired,
as long as the overall shape has some subjective level of symmetry or repetition
or follow the contours of some natural feature.
For those layouts, which for large fields can be very peculiar indeed,
the separation rule is relaxed slightly,
removing the minimum and trebling the maximum.
Flags still cannot touch each other physically, however.

Finally, a completely unofficial but very common practise
is to put a piece of hard ground in the area directly behind a flagpole.
The reason is a practical one:
a hard ground makes it easy for putting up and setting down a flag
by allowing a steady platform for one to put a ladder or similar implement on.
This is sometimes conspicuous and sometimes disguised,
and there is a public perception that it is an important part of a flagpole,
even though it isn't.

### Raising or lowering a flag ###

Putting up and setting down a flag is a straightforward manner,
and is usually not a very ceremonious one.
There are two types,
and it depends on whether or not the pole is a permanent installation or not.

The first type, mobile flags, can be short (three metres)
and usually have pole markings.
They are mounted simply by ramming the pole into the ground.
These poles have a sharpened bottom so as to ease ramming,
and fields that have holes for mobile flags are usually tapered at the bottom
to accommodate this spike.
Their shortness also indicates that they have prestige over the permanent flags,
which is useful as guests are usually treated as such.
Removing them is also simple; simply take the pole out of its original place.

Permanent flags and flagpoles are slightly different.
Permanent poles are rarely coloured,
and those that are are usually reserved for a single flag.
They have holes drilled onto the back
for the mounting brackets that are glued on every sign's back.
More recently sophisticated backs have been created
with slots that can slide open and shut
so that almost all heights can be accommodated.

With permanent poles one mounts a flag by bringing it over the top of the pole,
then sliding it down to the desired height.
Then, using either ordinary nails or special screws with twist knobs,
the flag is screwed on, from bottom to top.
This is why there are hard surfaces at the back of the pole;
one would mount it by going that high up and fixing the flag in place.
Dismounting the flag is trivial, then; simply mount the flag, but time-reversed.

## Manymounting ##

![An example of two flags mounted serially.
In this example, two documentation flags are used.
Even so, the tallness of this flag combination
justifies the hard limitation of
six flags per pole mounted serially.](img/serial-manymounting.png)

Manymounting is the practise of mounting more than one flag on the same pole.
It is different from merely putting one flag next to another in a field,
and there are two, not just one, way to mount more than one flag on one pole.
The most obvious way that this can be done
is to simply put one flag on top of another.
This is called <dfn>serial manymounting</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: želuue̲dulb̲lsa)
One can repeat this for up to 6 flags at a time.
The hard cap is to ensure that the highest flags are not so high
that its details cannot be seen without using some kind of periscope or ladder.
Still, the hard cap is rarely reached;
the maximum that most will ever see is three,
and two is far more common.

If for whatever reason more than six is needed,
the typical solution is to mount the next set in another pole,
slightly above and to the viewer's right of the mounting point of the first pole
with a beam angled to that effect.
The tilted beam is to ensure that the situation
is not to be confused with parallel manymounting.
However, with each new <dfn>extension beam</dfn> one fewer flag can be mounted,
leaving a new maximum of 21 flags;
and of course all of those extra flags have to be supported somehow,
usually using counterweights on the left-hand side or lots of trusses.
Still, the new 21-flag limit is considered high enough
for virtually all circumstances.

This kind of mounting is fairly simple
and is used to indicate hierarchal relationships,
such as city/state/country or individual/boss.
It should be noted that the flags closer to the *bottom*
are the ones that are considered more important, not the ones at the top;
the reasoning here is that reading things is done starting at normal eye level
and moving away from that, which in the case of flags,
one starts at the one closest to eye level, which is the bottom flag.
This also explains why the hard cap of six is not very restrictive;
often one does not sign every hierarchical level on a flag,
leaving only two or three important ones above one's own.

Since flags are allowed to specify their own pole colours,
what happens when two flags specify different colours are put together?
There are several solutions:
the most obvious one is to select one flag that dominates over the other,
in which case we choose the bottom flag, as it is in the position of honour.
But one can also elect to use the neutral colour, favouring no one,
or paint different sections of the pole according to the flag just above it.
Different societies have different solutions, and all three mentioned here
are commonly understood.

![An example of parallel manymounting.
Note that as these are documentation flags,
these two configurations
do not conflict with each other.](img/parallel-manymounting.png)

The other way to do it is to mount many flags, one next to each other,
but on the same (modified) pole.
This is called <dfn>parallel manymounting</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: želuue̲dup̲llůinbřu)
and is much more complex than serial manymounting.
In parallel mounting, the pole splits into two or more at some specified point,
and from there on each one can can sport any flag or flag combination.

Parallel manymounting has several features
that distinguishes it from its serial cousin.
For instance, unlike serial manymounting there is *no upper bound*
to the number of flags that can be parallel-manymounted in the same pole;
one can choose to place as many flags in parallel
on the same pole as one wishes,
though of course limitations can occur by other means, such as available space.

These flags can be very large –
extreme cases can have more than thirty or forty flags mounted on the same pole,
so extra support is needed for these flag assemblies.
All flags are fed through a <dfn>truss</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: aķdžœ)
at the lower end of their individual poles,
which then joins to the <dfn>master pole</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: lelëdæn),
which is the pole that finally attaches the whole lot to the ground.
In order to allow further support,
diagonal rods known as <dfn>struts</dfn> (E.-Pasaru: unzl̲edæn)
and vertical rods known as <dfn>auxiliary poles</dfn>
can be used to reïnforce the structure.
Struts do not touch the ground 

Secondly, flags mounted in parallel have equal standing with each other.
This can be overridden by having one flag be shorter than all the rest,
but this is rarely done and in the end the cultural norm
is that when flags are mounted in parallel,
no object referred to in that assembly is more important than another.
*If* however one is required, one can mount a flag in series,
but make the upper "flag" a parallel manymounting.

Finally, parallel mounting results in a consequence –
there is a space for a legend to be placed at the base of the manymounting.
This legend, which even if present is still just called a legend,
is used to label the manymounting in its entirety,
and usually draws its symbols
from the name of the union of the objects that take part in the manymounting.
This means that in some cases, unions don't have flags of their own,
just the parallel manymounting of its members.

# Making a flag #
Unlike Earthling (Western) flags,
which are typically made out of coloured fabric,
Ovexes are made out of hard, easily painted material such as wood or stone.
Naturally, this means that paint is used to draw the picture in.

Those who make flags are called <dfn>flagmen</dfn> (yess̲en), unsurprisingly.
As a group they make sure everything from forest to finish goes smoothly.
They source the building material, cut it down to size,
and draw the lines on the banner.
