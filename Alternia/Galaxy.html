	Astronomically, Alternia is not a particularly interesting planet. It lives in what can 
	charitably be called a metropolis in a disconnected and isolated community – the Alternian 
	Galaxy. The galaxy itself is sequestered in one of the scariest, emptiest places in the 
	universe, with nary a plume of gas in many parsecs around.
</p>
<p>
	The Alternian Universe is even more bog-standard. The universe as a whole is quite homogenous,
	with thin strips of galaxy clusters spanning and surrounding very large voids, which contains
	very little. This layout is very much like ours, which may or may not be a coincidence.
</p>
<br class="push"/>
<h1 id="AlternianGalaxy">The Alternian Galaxy</h1>
<p>
	The Alternian Galaxy is the home, and so far only, Galaxy that hosts the Trolls. It is a 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_galaxy">void galaxy,</a>
	meaning that it exists in an environment that's relatively empty of galaxies. This has
	vast implications with the society.

<figcaption>Various data about the stars in the Alternian Galaxy</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	The galaxy, as will be noted, is very old, as is the universe. Being approximately fifty-seven
	billion years into its existence, the universe formed this galaxy about four billion years
	after its birth, and hence the age of the galaxy is 53 billion years old.
</p>
<p>
	The galaxy contains roughly 40% more stars than the Milky Way, but on average each star only 
	hosts 80% of the mass of an average star in the Milky Way, so the galactic mass isn't very 
	much bigger than ours. Mainly K and M stars dominate.
</p>
<p>
	For a distant observer not moving relative to the galaxy, the galaxy has a distinctive red glow
	common for aging galaxies, from all the red stars both young (red giants that are about eight to
	to twelve billion years old) and old (small red dwarves with lifetimes over one trillion years).
	The main implications of this is that the stars that are in it are already run down, and
	any new life that may occur would at best be isolative and resigned and at worst be
	non-existent.
</p>
<h2 id="LocationOfAlternia">The Location of Alternia</h2>
<p>
	The Alternian System is within the Alternian Galaxy (surprisingly enough). Currently, the 
	star is about 40% the way in towards the middle of the aging and collapsing spiral galaxy, 
	making one circuit around the galactic centre in about 150&nbsp;Myr.
</p>
<p>
	The system is not in any of the decaying spiral arms; it is now stuck in the now growing 
	elliptical core which is growing at a rate of about five to fifty stars every year. The central
	black hole has the size of about 1.6&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;M<sub>sol</sub>. Its 
	mass is growing only on the order of tonnes a year, and very rarely capture stars or stellar
	remnants, usually only sucking in what's left of the stellar gas.
</p>
<h2 id="ElsewhereInTheGalaxy">Elsewhere in the Galaxy</h2>
<p>
	Due to large amounts of geoengineering done by the Trolls, most planets are either uninhabitable
	to Trolls or have been massively terraformed. There is also an undisputed monopoly of power
	at the hands of the Trolls, though they themselves squabble quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
	As such there are very little, if any, life that isn't already a subject to the Trolls. 
	Exceptions include "desert planets", planets that cannot support water in its liquid form
	(this includes gas giants and
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planets">rogue planets</a>);
	"waterlogged planets", planets that can support water but there's too much of it (generally, 
	a planet's a "lost cause" if it has no oceans less than 42 km deep); and the oft-neglected
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_house">"nail planets"</a>, planets that have put up
	so much of a fight that to fight them is an untenable liability.
	This third class of planets are barely tolerated, and are often glossed over in the official 
	textbooks. Unconquered life also exists in conquered planets, often in the form of subterranean
	miners and deep-water-dwellers, environments that are hostile to Trolls.
</p>
<h1 id="Elsewhere">Beyond the Galaxy</h1>
<p>
	To the Trolls, there is no other "elsewhere" – the void filament that the Alternian Galaxy
	resides in is simply too thin, the next galaxy too far away. While these galaxies are by no
	means undetectable, they are by severely distant – the nearest galaxy, called Benskans, is
	35.1 ± 0.044&nbsp;Mly from Alternia, which, in other words, is quite far away.
</p>
<p>
	However, with our privileged viewpoint, we can look further into the void and out into the 
	more lively sections of the universe at large.
</p>
<h2 id="AlternianVoid">The Alternian Void</h2>
<figure class="minor" id="SpotTheDifferenceCompetition">
	<div style="margin-left:1%;">
		<img src="img/WhatANiceView.png" alt="Space!" style="width:48%; display:inline;"/>
		<img src="img/WhatANiceView.png" alt="Water!" style="width:48%; display:inline;"/>

	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	The Alternian Void is a fairly large void, with a diameter of about 110&nbsp;Mpc. Being a void,
	it contains very few galaxies, and the gas around here is very very sparse, with one lone 
	hydrogen atom floating around every 10<sup>5</sup> ~ 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>, 
	and heavier atoms seen in even smaller amounts. These tiny atoms zip around, almost never 
	colliding with each other.
</p>
<p>
	The view around here is equally depressing: a dark expanse, the light from
	the distant filaments all but faded into invisibility. Though the gas is sparse, it's still 
	<em>there</em>, and the Void is so large that what little light that could have reached your
	eyes would still be scattered away. With only your eyes, you can't see anything.
	Poetically speaking, it would be the closest thing to oblivion you can ever see.
</p>
<h2 id="VoidInhabitants">Objects in the Void</h2>
<aside>
	<h3>How do you know all this?</h3>
	<p>
		Though the Trolls have no records of these rogue planets, their behaviour and fate can be
		predicted both from rogue planets of our own universe's, and of galaxy-orbiting rogue
		planets which are documented in Alternia.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Obviously, the Void is just <em>empty</em>, not <em>completely empty</em>. Every thousand
	parsecs or so, you will encounter a rogue planet. These planets are smoother than 
	regular planets, because they (a) don't have that many things to hit them with and (b) 
	things that <em>do</em> hit them tend to wear them down more than they make big holes, 
	because the the offending collider is often a small chip of rock, which makes no bigger holes
	than they need to snugly fit into.
</p>
<p>
	The age of the universe means that a majority of rogue planets already had their internal
	heat supply, given either by radioactive decay of trace amounts of superheavy metals or by
	any satellites (very, very rare indeed) adding tidal stress to the planet, almost exhausted.
	There are no records on individual rogue planets – remember, these things are far away,
	tiny, and emit pretty much no light at all, as well as pointless and boring – but these are
	their general properties.
</p>
<p>
	Void filaments make their strenuous way across the void as well, metaphorically
	<del>piercing</del> <ins>half-heartedly poking</ins> the darkness with their dim, ~700 nm light.
	The Alternian Galaxy live in such a void filament, along with almost every other galaxy that
	lives in the Void. The closest void filament from the Alternian Filament is almost 20 Mpc from
	Alternia, almost twice as far as the nearest galaxy from Alternia, Benskans, which as 
	indicated above is 10.76 Mpc away.
</p>
<p>
	Are there any galaxies in the void that isn't part of a void filament? Yes. It's a little
	irregular galaxy, 31 Mpc away. It lies in almost the opposite direction of Benskans to 
	Alternia, and shows up as a blurry magnitude-15 spot in Alternian telescopes. The filament
	turns slightly at Alternia so it doesn't actually contain this little galaxy, which is, while
	known, still not named, as it is generally accepted that it is pointless to know about this
	stupid thing anyway.
</p>
<h2 id="BoundaryFilaments">The Four Bounding Filaments</h2>
<p class="notice">
	Note: these items are located using the 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system">
		equatorial coordinate system,
	</a>
	with the centre set at the centre of Alternia in the present day. For orthographically
	convenient reasons however, Celestial Longitude, which is measured in degrees, replaces right
	ascension, which is measured in hours. 0° Celestial Longitude is equivalent to 0h right
	ascension. Declination is similarly changed to use °N and °S in place of + and − respectively.
<p>
	There are four
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_filament">filaments</a> that define the
	boundaries of the void, and they are relatively stringy, very
	aged, and of course unnamed due to general Troll ignorance about them, be it true or enforced.
	These filaments span a good 50° or so of the Alternian sky, but are usually no thicker than the
	galaxies
	that they contain. Their lengths, from shortest to longest, are 150 ± 25, 200 ± 25, 375 ± 25,
	and 425 ± 25 Mpc long. As they lack a convenient name to refer to, this article with refer
	to them using their lengths, as "One Hundred", "Two Hundred", "Three Hundred" and "Four 
	Hundred".
</p>
<p>
	The nearest of these four filaments is Two Hundred, which is also the one that comes closest to
	the Celestial South Pole. Containing about one galaxy cluster every 50 to 70 Mpc at its
	thickest and every 400 to 600 Mpc at its thinnest. Two Hundred primarily contains old galaxies
	and looks yellowish when viewed from a sufficient distance. At its closest point, 58°S 24°E,
	it is about 43 Mpc from Alternia.
</p>
<p>
	The next closest one, One Hundred, is slightly younger than Two Hundred, but it's also quite
	small. This one stretches a diagonal line across the Celestial Sphere, starting from
	30°S 141°E, coming to its closest point at 6°N 81°E, and fading back out at 48°N 19°E. It's 
	about 64 Mpc from Alternia, and is at that point magnitude 25 (although the non-negligible
	redshift at these distance may render this number rather useless.)
</p>
<p>
	Three Hundred is the next closest one after One Hundred, and is about 80 Mpc away from Alternia
	at its closest. This filament is the brightest and densest one of them them all, but it
	doesn't contain as much mass as Four Hundred. On average, there is a supercluster every 50 to
	60 Mpc, which is significantly more than that of Two Hundred. On the Celestial Sphere,
	it starts at 50°N 15°W and ends at 0°N 121°W, with its maximal brightness of magnitude 26.4
	achieved at 22°N 70°W.
</p>
<p>
	The most distant and most massive Four Hundred is on the far end of the thick end of the 
	Alternian Void. It's almost 120 Mpc away from Alternia at its closest point, and spans
	a rough line from 80°N 128°W to 40°N 45°E, coming closest towards the Celestial North Pole
	at about 88°N 64°W. Four Hundred is also younger than the other filaments by a margin
	of several billion years, and if you were close enough to see it, it glows bright white, in
	contrast of the dull orange-yellow glow of nearby filaments.
</p>
<h2 id="NearbySuperstructures">Nearby Superstructures</h2>
<p>
	The closest non-Void supercluster to Alternia resides in One Hundred. This supercluster,
	which doesn't even have a number to itself, contains about 2,200 galaxies, grouped into about 
	400 clusters. Like all superclusters, this one is slowly drifting apart because
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_expansion">
		gravity is too weak to hold it together.
	</a>.
</p>
<p>
	(Incidentally, this is also the nearest supercluster full stop to Alternia, because there 
	are no superclusters in the Alternian Void, in the sense that there are no gravitationally
	unbound but proximate groups of gravitationally bound galaxy clusters. Individual clusters,
	or even individual galaxies, are strung together to form the void filaments, and no 
	superclusters are involved.)
</p>
<p>
	Beyond the Four Boundary Filaments, there exist a few other other filaments within 500 Mpc
	(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space"><var>z</var></a> = 0.01).
	The longest of these is around 540 ± 30 Mpc long and 70: kpc wide and thick, and continues
	more or less perpendicularly to One Hundred. At its closest, it is 440 ± 15 Mpc away from
	Alternia, and this point is roughly at coordinates 32°N 174°W. The largest supercluster in
	500 Mpc is in this filament, and contains about 6,000 galaxies broken up into about 500 groups.
	Light from this supercluster, and this filament is orange, given proximity.
</p>
<p>
	Walls, also known as fat filaments, do not exist within 500 Mpc of Alternia, though two exist
	within 1 Gpc. The first one, with point of closest approach at about 700 Mpc, is 3 Mpc thick,
	33 Mpc wide and 400 Mpc long. The other one has a closest approach of around 900 Mpc, 
	and is 9 Mpc thick, 50 Mpc wide and so long that one end falls beyond magnitude 40 – an
	estimation is that it's almost 1 Gpc long.
</p>
<p>
	Unusually, there's also a fat wall, or a full block of galaxies, within 1 Gpc of Alternia.
	This "block" as a whole is magnitude 35, and is 300 Mpc tall, 200 Mpc wide and 250 Mpc thick,
	making it undeniably not a filament or a wall. In the celestial sphere, its coordinates are
	18°S, 33°W. There is no consensus of where this block came
	from, mainly because no Troll has heard (and will ever hear) about it.
</p>
<h2 id="LargeScaleStructure">The Large-Scale Structure</h2>
<figure>
	<img
		src="img/universe.gif"
		alt="Image of our universe within 14 Gly of the Sun"
		class="lowres"
	/>
	<figcaption>
		<a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/universe.html">This image</a> shows our own 
		universe out to 14 billion light years of the Sun. The universe that Alternia lives in
		is expected to look much the same.
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	The large-scale structure of the Alternian universe is believed to be much the same as the 
	large-scale structure of our universe: long, stringy filaments of clusters and superclusters
	surrounding huge voids of nearly nothing. The overall density of voids and filaments are 
	roughly the same throughout the universe, making them look like a Petri dish of soap bubbles.
</p>
<p>
	There are differences though. One that stands out almost immediately is that the Alternian
	Universe is much larger – relative to Alternia, the radius of the observable universe is around
	450 Gly, consistent with its 57 Ga age. The Alternian universe is also growing much
	faster than our universe, with its
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble's_law">Hubble constant</a> currently evaluated
	to be about 135.43 ± 2.4 km s<sup>−1</sup> Mpc.
</p>
<p>
	There are no doubt countless interesting features in the Alternian universe, and a vast
	majority of them are not aware that some planet nine billion kersplodges away has been 
	completely obliterated. One may even think that the universe as a whole emerged quite unscathed
	from the whole 0 RD problem – it continues to age, and teeter towards its eventual final end
	state.
</p>
<p>
	There may even be life in these distant domains, so far away that they are out of reach
	of the Trolls. Some of them might even have managed to catch wind of this difficult species
	and prayed that they never reach them, or scoff at their technological and/or moral inexpertise
	as they attempt to slaughter and enslave all they encounter in an attempt to rule over
	their little patch of land. There may even be intelligent species that will never hear of
	the Trolls. In any case, it may be best for those ignorant people to never hear of the Trolls
	and vice versa, for who can predict the explosive consequences that will ensue?
</p>
<h1 id="BeyondTheUniverse">Beyond the Universe</h1>
<p>
	The limit of the observable universe from Alternia is 450 Gly or about 140 Gpc, which you
	may compare to ours' 93 Gly. The actual Alternian universe is a bit bigger than that,
	but we truly do not know how large it is. We <em>do</em> know however it has an edge of some
	description – if not in the three spatial dimensions then at least at one end of the time 
	dimension, and for certain it is bounded in one of the non-classical spatial dimensions –
	because things have been referred as to be "outside" this Universe.
</p>
<p>
	What lies in this strange land? The interuniversal medium is a strange place to encounter.
	Because we lie beyond the boundary of this universe, linear distances that span beyond this
	boundary become mere mathematical abstractions, with very little bearing on what the physical
	world holds. Rather than transcending <em>all</em> time and space however, the interuniversal
	medium merely resides in its own time and space, although in this case time and space are
	even more similar than usual due to the strange and wonderful fact that time in the
	interuniversal medium is directed, but not <em>wholly</em> unidirectional.
</p>
<p>
	What does the boundary look like? Well, the problem with most universes is that you can't
	usually escape them – they act a little bit like a 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere">3</a>-torus – an <i>Asteroids</i> gamefield
	in three dimensions – but it looks like a sphere from the inside, in which you are returned
	to the antipodal point. To escape the universe, you need to move in a completely different
	direction to these directions.
</p>
<p>
	But once you do, you will be greeted with the view that is wonderfully encapsulated in 
	Fig.&nbsp;2.1a. You will have to acquaint yourself with the new coordinate system. Things 
	are very foggy in there, and since this is a different time and space, you may move three inches
	and find that you have left the Alternian universe far behind already.
</p>
<p>
	What this place has to offer are universes and more universes, those that are of utter
	uselessness to any form of life and others that proliferate with (and sometimes, plagued with)
	them. These things are not fixed relative to the space-time that this strange interuniversal
	medium has. Indeed, if it wasn't for this being a mental exercise, it is not known if you'll
	even pass the barrier and still <em>exist</em> on the other side.
</p>
<p>
	If you manage to not just exist there but to survive there however, you can move. And once you
	move far enough, you might just find Earth.
</p>
<p>But that's a story for another time.</p>
