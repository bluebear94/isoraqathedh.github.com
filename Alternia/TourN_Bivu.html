	Sewb is a large U-shaped land straddling the equator. As such, it's tropical and fertile, 
	but there's a giant pimple that somewhat spoils it – that thing is the Wrro Plateau, which 
	turns otherwise highly verdant rainforest into cooler, dryer savannah. You can also say that
	this giant pimple also created another giant pimple on Alternia – that is, if you are not 
	exactly for Trolls populating nearby worlds – but don't say that out loud near Troll
	settlements!
</p>

</figure>
<p>
	The continent can roughly be divided into several regions, going from west to east. The diagram
	at right shows these lands and how they are connected up by roads.
</p>
<p>
	We will start our journey on Oae, and follow the Orange Line down to Wriu, detailing much of the
	points of interests on the way. We will also follow the other parallel tracks to complete
	the description of the land.
</p>
<h1 id="Bivu">Bivu</h1>
<figure>
	<img src="img/Map_BivuAndYiwgg.jpg"/>
	<figcaption>A map of Bivu, Yiwgg, and Phiabsia. A grid square is 71.9 km on a side.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	We cross the Saesson Gap by means of an enormous bridge crossing the 100 km+ strait. This bridge
	is called the Kapma Bridge, and for good reason – it bridges South and North Kapma, twin
	settlements on both sides of the Gap that had a long and colorful history of loving and hating
	each other. The bridge crosses the Gap over 300 m off from the sea level, meaning that once you
	fall, you could be lost forever! Most animals and even some Trolls don't have to worry about 
	this because they can fly, but you can't.
</p>
<p>
	After about 30 minutes travelling we leave Kapma, speeding our way south and west towards
	the southern twin of Oae – Bivu. While the two looks superficially similar, they have no 
	relationship, being simply wrought of the same methods. Both of them were orogenies, and
	many million years of tectonic drift has caused them to meet in this very day.
</p>
<p>
	The vegetation here is very dense – the <abbr>ITCZ</abbr> stays around here most of the year,
	so it's always wet around here, and when it isn't you can see the sun very high up in the sky.
	Very tall forests everywhere! Well, except where it's been cut down for roads and such. 
</p>
<p>
	Closer to the shore, and especially where small rivers meet the sea, there exists huge mangrove
	forests that span many hundreds of hectares, running almost up to 1 km inland in some places.
	This rich forest thins inland to simple forest with some really tall trees dotted here and 
	there, and of course the whole thing is criss-crossed with a full megametre of road (more or 
	less).
</p>
<p>
	Most animals here are at most 3 m long and don't move very fast because of the dense forest.
	However, the treetops are a different story. If you must fly, by hang-glider or otherwise
	(the dense air makes hang-gliding more like hang-<em>flying</em>) stay up. Silvicultural animals
	abound in the tallest of the mangroves and inland trees, and you look like a particularly meaty
	and weak bird – mainly because you <em>are</em>.
</p>
<p>
	Since we are heading west, we shall completely miss <a href="#Yiwgg">Yiwgg</a> on the east.
	Don't worry! If you want to go there, just click on that link. Or scroll on till you find the 
	relevant section.
</p>
<p>
	After a couple dozen kilometres, we end up seeing a ridge rise up in the sky. We have crossed
	the equator a long time ago, and this really tall ridge is of course none other than the
	Bivusti Range.
</p>
<h2 id="Bivusti">Bivusti Mountains</h2>
<figure class="minor bigger">
	<a href="img/BivustiMountainStats.png"><img src="img/BivustiMountainStats.png"/></a>
	<figcaption>Selected mountains in the Bivusti Range and their heights.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	The Bivusti mountains are tall and long but otherwise not very notable, almost comparable to
	that of the Zagros or a slightly beefier Appalachian range. The slopes here go up 
	relatively gently due to long years of weathering, and the tallest mountains range in the 
	3000 – 4000 m range. Since this range is close to the equator, it hardly contains any snow at 
	all, even in the coldest winters – in colder times though, frost does occur. The highest
	range in this range is Mt. Trraen-iaut, at 3845 m.
</p>
<p>
	The mountains, as one would expect of such a large geographical feature, have some effect
	on the surrounding land. The mountains trap a little bit of rain, so rivers do form there,
	but they're not particularly long; on the other hand, the mountains are not <em>so</em> tall
	that they completely block out clouds rolling in from the Saesson sea to the east, meaning
	that the west coast is not so dry. Compare the situation coming along in
	<a href="TourS_Quagg-dulle.html#Aew-xrriad-nij">Aew-xrriad-nij</a> desert, where rain-blocking
	mountains from both sides of the continent creates a sweltering dead zone…
</p>
<p>
	The mountains do not have much of a trend of height going from north to south, so it is
	fair to assume that these are created more or less from the same technique and at around the 
	same time as well.
</p>
<h3 id="Karsti">Karsti and Senaei</h3>
<p>
	To the north lies the Karsti Plain, a sometimes-arid plain that's green in good years and 
	become a brilliant shade of green-olive in the worse years. Heading south along the dry side of
	the mountains, we see Bodo in the distance, but we shall skip that city, for that's just more
	of the same.
</p>
<aside>
	<h4>Flashback</h4>
	<p>
		In such a hot and wet location such as Alternia floods and heat waves are <em>much</em> more
		common than they are on Earth. That particular mangrove extent haven't been seen for over
		5&nbsp;000&nbsp;<span class="altYr">years</span>, though, to be sure.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	After passing a rather mountainous part of the lee side, we open up to some mangroves around
	the shore. The Senaei Mangroves are one of the many that dot the landscape around here,
	because even if the wind is blocked by the mountain rain is still plentiful from the entirely
	gratuitous amount of evaporation that occurs this close to the equator. The mangroves do 
	visibly shrink and grow depending on the year though &ndash; that purple road shows its furthest
	extent ever achieved &ndash; it's a particularly rainy year, that year, so many years ago.
</p>
<p>
	From here on let us go up across the mountains up the River Yrup and through Uyiun-thegf Pass,
	a homely little pass only 1&nbsp;858&nbsp;m up from the sea level. Through there you'll pass
	through the town of Baerheetj, a town of about 18&nbsp;000. Being further up the hill and hence
	in slightly less favourable environments than the rest of the Troll society, the people in
	Baerheetj is <em>slightly</em> less likely to kill you impulsively. Don't push your luck here!
	Find a room and sleep through the night.
</p>
<h3 id="Owpssia">Owpssia Rainforest</h3>
<p>
	The following morning we head back down the hill again and continue to follow the road to 
	Ardaet. As we head down, we notice that the trees are growing a little taller than
	on the lee side we just left. We're in the zone of relief rain! Although it doesn't mean much
	this close to the tropics, microecoystems are much more abundant here, so watch your step
	with the poisonous snake-like animals and bugs that carry bacteria that even the most feverent
	of (exo)biology enthusiasts won't dream of in a thousand years.
</p>
<p>
	The beauty of this place is only exemplified from far up in a satellite view, of course; down
	here in the thick of it, even when separated by a large fence and standing on tarmac in the 
	lower stretches, it's a dark and scary place in there. The tree growth is so fierce here that
	there are parts of the forest floor that receive absolutely no direct insolation at all. The
	most vibrant life exists in silvicultural <em>wild lusus</em> living arboreally and generally
	having a great time enjoying themselves. (Some of them however are worried sick because they are
	lusus of "culled" Trolls, but that's another story.)
</p>
<p>(A note to fliers: watch it. The lusus bite.)</p>
<aside>
	<h4>The Trees are the Limit</h4>
	<p>
		The rainforests are dense. These trees block large animals from entering, so animals
		that evolved here are small, generally no more than half a metre in any dimension.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	As we descend, the land becomes wetter and wetter, and soon the mangroves and swamps start
	coming back, and they are back <em>with a vengeance</em>! Huge, 40-metre super-trees sprout
	from the ground to the sky with the speed of bamboo (an exaggeration, but not by much: these
	things go from sapling to 20-metre monsters in about 80 weeks, and in another 100 they would
	have grown to near full-size), and there are huge fliers abound in the treetops. The ground
	still doesn't have much insolation, but down here there evolved some lampyroids that give off
	light in hopes of attracting mates. These lampyroids, when adult are now about 8&nbsp;cm long
	and 5&nbsp;cm wide &ndash; not bad for a firefly-like insect!
</p>
<p>
	These lamps are the only light down here in the shade of the super-trees, and animals around
	here have come to respect these lights, because most of them have not evolved out their eyes 
	yet. Generally speaking, there exists a rough symbiotic relationship between the lampyroids
	and the rest of the subarboreal ecosystems, mainly out of selection &ndash; societies that harm
	the lampyroids died out pretty quickly, because (a) the predators can't see anymore and 
	(b) like most Terran fireflies lampyroids are toxic (ironically, if ingested some species
	excrete poison that cause blindness). Some slightly larger animals, such as mega-dragonflies
	with wingspans approaching 30&nbsp;cm, even have little hatches where lamypyroids can settle
	in quite well, giving partial immunity to the mega-dragonflies and giving the lampyroids a
	rest.
</p>
<p>
	Eventually we'll finally escape the wild and enter civilization once more, as we finally 
	get to Ardaet.
</p>
<h3 id="Ardaet">Ardaet</h3>
<p>
	The city of about 1 million has an urban sprawl about 180&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and has a 
	reasonably complete transportation and food store. Ardaet is just another bland city in the
	list of ports, with a slight bent on fishmongering and on occasion some really impressive
	lights at night. It puts up a small light show every night if weather permits, though generally
	speaking the viewership count is kind of low.
</p>
<p>
	Its flora and fauna however are something more to talk about! There are well over 3&nbsp;000
	genera and 9&nbsp;000 species in the city, and the biodiversity in the suburban and rural
	zones are even higher. Most of the buildings here recognize the virility of the growth and
	hence grow on stilts (Trolls either live on land or in the sea, not in some land-sea mish-mash!)
	with very few exceptions. This being in the edge of the Enigo Mangroves further to the north,
	there are no shortage of frog-like amphibians and also lizards and mega-dragonflies.
</p>
<p>
	Further to the north lies Jombox and the Bossni Forest; those places are like the Senaei 
	Mangroves that we have already seen. Jombox though is a major port city, unlike Ardaet, and 
	the city is much larger, with about 3.5 million Trolls calling the place home. Jombox has a
	large harbour with an average width of about 2.2&nbsp;km and it has taken much advantage of it,
	such as building piers and leasing it out at times as storm shelters.
</p>
<p>
	But here, we shall head south, down towards Mt. Tsuppin and finally Sakin. We'll see many things
	on the way.
</p>
<h3 id="Danak">The Danak Plain</h3>
<aside>
	<h4>Flashback</h4>
	<p>
		The last time the climate was cold enough to entirely drain the Yiwgg Sea was
		15.5 million years ago during the Thrionth Minimum. The Sea was cut off by the lowered
		sea level (the underwater pass was about 110&nbsp;m below current sea level; it's not hard)
		and the intense evaporation dried it out in less than 4000 years. The effect on the 
		biosphere was disasterous, to say the least.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	We head south once more, towards Asiddum, another town. This one is slightly bigger than 
	Ardaet though, because it's one of the guard cities of the Yiwgg Sea, the gulf-in-a-gulf that
	opens only to the Baeta Gulf to the south. In drier times, this can dry completely into a 
	valley, which hasn't happened to the Trolls. It wouldn't matter though; the valley would
	be salt-lined, which isn't conducive to life, Troll or not.
</p>
<p>
	As we keep our steady south course, very slowly the viral growth of the Equator gives way to 
	something more managable, more deniable. Keep in mind though that this is still less than
	ten degrees away from the equator and the storms are still quite strong, even when the narrow
	sea here is considered. The narrowed sea, and the increased amount of landmass upwind, 
	<em>does</em> make the reduction in biodiversity clear &ndash; the swamps and mangroves give
	way to just rainforest with some quagmires and bogs. It's not <em>too</em> bad, but it's
	visible, barely.
</p>
<p>
	This pattern continues until we head all the way down to Asiddum. Here the shore bends west
	and we follow that bend.
</p>
<p>
	We cross the Ounsiat river, a river of about 300&nbsp;km. This place is quite choked with those
	monster trees again, because the Yiwgg Peninsula, further to the left, no longer restricts 
	the accumulation of storms. Fueled by the Baeta Gulf, the rain becomes more frequent and 
	intense, so things become more fertile! The mangroves and swamps come back, and all is well 
	again.
</p>
<p>
	Another 150&nbsp;km later, we follow a small bay around and turn south once again, and encounter
	a crossroads. To the west lies the smallish town of Meyani and a pass of the same name; further
	beyond that lies Mt. Piona, a relatively short mountain with elevation 2330&nbsp;m. Mt. Piona
	is short, and since it's so close to the equator, the mountain has no snow at all, even in what
	can be generously be called winters. Meyani itself isn't very high up either &ndash; just 
	1110&nbsp;m, the lowest pass so far. Continuing further to the west, you'll meet up with the 
	other shore again &ndash; this shore is now not of the Peetegge's now that we have passed the
	equator; it's now the Idjae Ocean that you see beyond the shore.
</p>
<p>
	Now, though, we head south on that crossroads, and approach Exerit through the Danak Plain.
	The Danak is a great plain, though calling it a plain is quite inaccurate as its terrain is
	anything but. The plain is studded with mountains of the Bivusti, and the overall look is
	far more mottled, with hills everywhere and some bare grass protruding out in places
	where some mountains have poked above the tree line. No mountains here are taller than the
	vegetation line here though, so most of the land remains green much of the year.
</p>
<p>
	This detail makes the biodiversity increase a bit. Lots of mountains make lots of shaded areas,
	which makes for an increased amount of environments. One thing the Danak doesn't have however
	is a major river to really boost the life in this area. Without that river, it's just another
	plain. The rains do penetrate however, so the water problem is not severe.
</p>
<p>
	Soon we shall leave the Danak Plain and, with it, the last of the mountains in the Bivusti
	Range. Geographically, the mountains continue, but they are now shorter, less distinctive,
	andso politically they aren't part of the range. We also approach a plain that is actually
	plain, at least in terrain: the Hfalur.
</p>
<h3 id="Hfalur">Hfalur and Sakin</h3>
<p>
	The Hfalur Plain is pretty much the first place in over two thousand kilometres where
	the east and west coast of Bivu actually meet. It's a pretty standard plain, sometimes bordering
	on open and dense forest; on occasion there is also rainforest in the east. The flora and fauna
	continue to be much the same, though the animals, now no longer limited by the density of the
	trees, start growing in size. Mega-dragonflies here can grow up to 50&nbsp;cm in size, which is
	twice as large as anything similar further north!
</p>
<p>
	Not only that, the openness of the place allow much larger animals. Again, be careful. They
	also bite. Stick to some semblance of civilization!
</p>
<figure class="minor bigger">
	<a href="img/Map_Sakin.jpg"><img src="img/Map_Sakin.jpg"/></a>
	<figcaption>A map of Sakin. Click to enlarge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	After some more walking, one wil arrive at the last of Bivu: Sakin. Sakin is a major city,
	one that no one forgets. It's a cultural centre and a transport centre as well. This is the 
	place where ferries converge and so do ideas. Many Trolls of many kinds meet here, and so your 
	life here will be slightly easier.
</p>
<p>
	The city is divided modularly, like a lot of cities in Alternia. As usual, you'd want the
	"touristry" section of the city, which, again as usual, is locked deep in the middle of the 
	city, rather than near the coast or out towards the countryside, like similar tourist locations
	on Earth will.
</p>
<p>
	The city has underwent some significant reclamation as well, adding land through several 
	hundred years of expansion into the shore. In the figure to the right, the thick black line
	denotes the original coastline, the blue-bordered line indicates the current coastline, and 
	the difference is made by the Caerrvu and Ssrosvul Reclamation Zones. The Caerrvu in particular
	is very large, adding 22.8 km² to the area of the city (compared to the Ssrosvul, with only 3.7)
	and and turned two islands, Towgg and Inio, into part of the mainland. The third island, 
	Oukaevu, remains separate because that's where the highbloods live. Various seamounts in the 
	nearby seas make for good living there.

	<figcaption>
		Climatic Chart of Sakin. Sakin is a tropical/subtropical city, meaning it gets consistently
		high temperatures. However, "high" has a different meaning in Alternia than it does on
		Earth…
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<aside>
	<h4>Flashforward</h4>
	<p>
		In the next five hundred years, the location that Sakin occupies will see even higher 
		temperatures, with the record in that period being around 55°C (131°F).
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Sakin is a wonderful candidate for demonstrating what a "tropical climate" means in Alternia.
	As you can see, the increased global temperature pushed this city's temperature up by several
	degrees, making 40-degree weather a very common experience. The record high temperature, 
	51.2 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded only 18 years ago, on a steamy
	second month that also was the most humid year on record. It was stated that there was a 
	"feels like" temperature of 177.8°C (352.1°F) on the ninth day of that month, because 
	of a gut-wrenchingly high 90% relative humidity. That heat wave was just barely manageable
	for Trolls &ndash; but <em>you</em>...
</p>
<p>
	The lesson to take away from this is that you have to be very careful about your cooling systems
	when visiting such even subtropical cities. Further up north you had mountains to keep you 
	cool due to lapse rates, but beyond that there's no way out until the Wrro Plateau. 
</p>
<p>
	So after a couple of days of staying in the city, eating up and trying not to catch heatstroke,
	you have several choices to get leave the place:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You can follow the <strong style="color:red;">Red Line</strong> head west off into the
		depths of the Idjae Ocean, using the handy 
		<a href="TourS_Hrheew-yrrvu.html#Hscanthmou">Hscanthmou Islands</a>
		(well, handy to use, but not easy to pronounce!) as a neat stepping stone or a mid-way point
		for any traveller.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can go east instead and try and cross the Baete Gulf, which was a bit silly because
		you had a chance to do so back in Asiddum when it's narrow. There are a couple ferries
		that will bring you from here to Sakkar however.
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally, you can head south towards the Iekka Islands, following the 
		<strong style="color:orange;">Orange Line</strong>. In that case, read on...
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Iekka">Iekka Islands</h2>
<figure>
	<img src="img/Map_Iekka.jpg"/>
	<figcaption>
		A map of the Iekka Islands. As with the above map, one small square is 71.9 km on each side.
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	The Iekka Islands are an archipelago that closes most of the Baeta Gulf to the north, leaving
	large gaps. The islands of course leave gaps that boats can sail through, meaning that 
	it's a convenient choke point for trade and other things.
</p>
<p>
	These islands have two main biomes: the bigger ones to the north often have climates 
	similar to Sakin, but more extreme as they move further from the equator. Moreover the islands
	also become progressively drier as it closes the Baeta Gulf and comes closer to the mainland.
	While the northern islands are fairly mediterranean (well, in Alternian terms &ndash; actual
	Greeks will melt under the climate of the Iekkas!) and the south is dry and hot. With the 
	exception of Kreggle, the islands on this end are uninhabited.
</p>
<h3 id="Bthebb">Bthebb</h3>
<figure class="minor">
	<img src="img/Map_Bthebb.jpg"/>
	<figcaption>A map of Bthebb.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Bthebb is the largest island in the Iekkas, and it contains two peaks, Potec which is 
	2995&nbsp;m high and Heggra, which is 3390&nbsp;m tall. These twin mountains are enough
	to wrench a little bit of rain, feeding two rivers, the Rokk and the Afhobb.
</p>
<p>
	The island, 380&nbsp;km wide and 370 km long, supports two cities, named Ssatha and
	Ankricch. The two cities have a bit of a rivalry with each other, epsecially because both the 
	Aekka Strait, separating Bthebb from the mainland, and the Kthomi Strait, that separates 
	Bthebb from Giae and Gfia, are heavily used and have very little difference with regards to
	the raw usability. As such the place can sometimes have flare-ups and mini-wars. There are a
	handful of smaller settlements too, but most of them just get caught in the crossfire or lay
	allegience to one of the two towns.
</p>
<p>
	The vegetation here is pretty standard, but unlike the rest of the islands Bthebb actually has
	a semblance of an "interior", meaning that the centre of the islands is open forest and
	grassy &ndash; despite the low latitude.
</p>
<p>
	As we head further on south though, the islands we see become smaller &ndash; and drier...
</p>
<h3 id="GiaeGfia">Giae and Gfia</h3>
<p>
	Giae and Gfia are a pair of twin islands that are fairly similar to each other and hence can be
	dealt with in more or less the same section. The two islands are about 180&nbsp;km in size and 
	contain much less vegetation and much fewer inhabitants than either Deiokup to the sourth or 
	Bthebb to the north. While Bthebb houses 8 million people and Deiokup 1 million, Gfia hosts
	only one large city, Sotac, with a measly 350 thousand people, and Giae, off-course from the 
	Iekka Highway (a shipping land/sea route that stretches from Sakin to Kente) doesn't host any
	major city at all, with a total population being a cool 3300.
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, Gfia is marginally larger than Giae in geographic terms. Whereas Giae hosts Mt. 
	Alonge (a·lon·ge, not a·long·ge!), soaring a majestic 1565&nbsp;m above sea level, Gfia has
	Mt. Espyo, a peak that measures over 2350&nbsp;m above sea level. Both mountains are remains of
	volcanoes, or close enough to being one; though no one has seem them erupt before, though one
	must note that the destructive plate boundary that created these islands so no signs of abating
	its subduction, so that must be kept in mind.
</p>
<p>
	As stated, Giae has very few civilized conveniences, and as a result has more biomass than its
	larger cousin to the East; being close to Ankricch though means that it's not <em>entirely</em>
	uninhabited, and hence it's not really entirely virgin forest (well, virgin open forest with
	a large amount of prairie feel to it as this is the subtropical region). Civilzation-wise, 
	Giae has a handful of reculses hiding out in some outcroppings especially near the summit of
	Alonge; similarly, there are many boarding schools and/or boot camps where what little of Troll
	culture is nurtured and developed.
</p>
<p>
	The two islands are otherwise much the same ecosystem: almost all plants are able to cross the
	narrow West Kthomi Channel that separates the two, as well as the Strait of the same name
	that separates the two islands from Bthebb. Animals are a slightly different story: most animals
	here are small and mice-like, bigger animals having been downsized due to the size of the
	island.
</p>
<h3 id="Deiokup">Deiokup and Yutkkiop</h3>
<p>
	Deiokup is not really an island, in the same way that Giae and Gfia are islands. This island has
	two peaks: Ludikko, the taller of the two, measures 2010&nbsp;m in height; and the shorter
	Mt. Enefael measures 1455&nbsp;m from top to bottom. The two mountains connect to each other
	in a pass that is 45&nbsp;m above sea level.
</p>
<p>
	The pass contains a city of course, one that is actually fairly large compared to the size of 
	the island: Caelif. A low-lying city with over three million people under its wing, Caelif has
	many parts that live under the mean sea level, like Venice or most of the Netherlands, but it
	still has some parts that live above the sea level at all times; it is not under the threat of
	the sea level rising and drowning it (though to be honest it is known that it would be wiped out
	in as little as one <span class="altYr">year</span> anyway).
</p>
<p>
	Most of the remaining island land area is considered property of the city, and as such has
	been well cultured and domesticated. Because of this, there is certainly far lower biodiversity
	in Deiokup than the nearby undomesticated islands! Most of the place contains organized orchards
	and farms; some other places preserve some of the open forest but that's a minority.
</p>
<p>
	As we continue to head south the islands grow even smaller. Yutkkiop is not even part of 
	the same league as Deiokup, but as it is part of the administrative division that also holds
	Deiokup it is best left in this part (since when has geographical limitations ever transcended
	<del>human</del> <ins>troll</ins> stubbornness?) Yutkkiop is less than 75 km long and 20 km wide
	but still hosts one tiny port city of Oulaef, with a humble population of one thousand. The 
	island can be considered the last of the large islands, but it can also be considered the first
	of the Kreggle islands, that is to say that Yutkkiop is the very first of a series of islands
	that look very similar to each other, and those islands are:
</p>
<h3 id="Kreggle">Kreggle and the Minors</h3>
<p>
	Up until now things have been going relatively well in this area: since the Iekkas live in such
	a subtropical region the entire chain of islands are fairly well-off biodiversity-wise and hence
	it's one of those places that burst with activity. Still, there are those that are better off
	and those that are worse off, and now, as we reach the tail end of the islands, we also reach
	the tail end of the biodiversity line.
</p>
<p>
	Along the Iekka Highway, after Oulaef we shall arrive at Nahae, a homely town of less than 700 
	living on a barely-alive island known as Ssrand. The vegetation cover here is variable:
	sometimes, when the weather is good, you get very green fields; on the other hand, if the rains
	fail (and they <em>will</em> fail this far from the equator) you'll end up with crunchy 
	golden-brown grass everywhere.
</p>
<p>
	Of course, it would also be pertinent to note that the Iekka Highway completely skips over 
	Kaerst, another island, and also a handful of smaller islands here, including two that are 
	visible on the map but aren't named (they are Wra-yrriut on the left and Quaec on the right). 
	These are scrawny little islets barely worth mentioning, as they are all part of the giant 
	biome that is the Kreggle Steppe.
</p>
<p>
	Wandering a bit off the beaten track, Kyikko is the final small island in the Iekkas. This
	particular island, being further to the north than its compatriots that are directly in the
	Iekka Highway, receives far more rain than any of them and so has far more virulent growths
	and much better health overall. However, <em>because</em> it's such a far-off place, it doesn't
	get many visitors. Well… not really; it's the site of a military camp for much the same reason.
	Otherwise, it's more or less untouched landscape, with the base only covering a very small 
	amount of land on the 80 km × 60 km island.
</p>
<figure class="minor">
<img src="img/KregglePopDist.png" />
<figcaption>
	Population distribution in Kreggle, an island home to five million people.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Last but <em>certainly</em> not least, Kreggle! This wonderful island, craggy and mountainous,
	is the final gasp of the Iekka Islands before it finally gives in and sinks back further to 
	the south. So dramatic a book-end is the island that some people speculate it may be an 
	odd-one-out, and certainly by its rock age one can argue that – on average the rocks here are
	a handful of tens of millions of years older than the rocks back in, say, Kyikko. How it got 
	there that way though is a bit of a mystery.
</p>
<p>
	As for surface life, it's hanging on, but there's a firm grip that says that it's not leaving
	any time soon. Mt. Kapleew, a towering peak 1395 m tall, commands the whole island, and even
	gives it dry and wet (err, less-dry) sides by wringing out what little moisture that exists in
	such a high-pressure region. It's still not as bad as the inland equivalents, and after all 
	they are barely on the edge of the horse latitudes, but there's a palpable difference between
	living on the east side of the mountain and the west side of the mountain. Consequently, because
	of its dryness, there's quite an uneven distribution of population, as can be seen in the figure
	at left.
</p>
<p>
	This gives it a good "two-face" view when seen from the top: an green-olive open forest on the 
	east with lots of farmland but few people living in it, and a golden-grey grassland on the west
	with many more people but far less in terms of biodiversity. It's quite a breathtaking view,
	seen from high-up; even in a regular aeroplane, or even when you're flying on a pair of 
	strap-on wings, you can see the divide clearly.
</p>
<p>
	The island also hosts a city of two million: Faesia! This town is quite like Sakin in form, but
	is also much hillier and contains a few other things that may surprise the Troll who is used
	to the wonders of Sakin. Here, too, reclamation has taken its toll on the island, growing it by
	10 km<sup>2</sup>, not very much in the long run but very visible in the form of a straight line
	on the shore. There's a small by-road that allows people to continue past Faesia and back
	to the mainland if required.
</p>
<p>
	And after a good day taking a break in here we make another madcap dash out of here, to the 
	other side of Kreggle. Catch a ferry, fly; whatever your choice, we will make the jump across
	the Cinch of Saelaess and land in Kente a good fraction of a megametre away. But in the 
	meantime, let's see how things are going on, in Yiwgg and Phiabsia.
</p>
<h1 id="Yiwgg">Yiwgg</h1>
<figure><img src="img/Map_BivuAndYiwgg.jpg"/></figure>
<p>
	This time, instead of heading west and down Bivu, we shall head east through Phiabsia into
	Yiwgg.
</p>
<p>
	Being westwards of the much wider Saesson Sea, Phiabsia is by all means more fertile and in 
	general a better place to be (assuming that you are a sucker for biodiversity) than Yiwgg.
	On the other hand, without the nurturing seawater that the Baeta Gulf brings to the Iekka
	Islands, most of Yiwgg and even South Yiwgg (otherwise known as the Sakkarsti Territories,
	after Sakkar, an administrative city of this region) is far drier than the Iekkas to their
	west. This is not helped by the Wrro Plateau going full-on with the territory, blasting dry 
	air down, dissipating clouds. The only saving grace is that by the time they have reached the 
	shore the airmass is warm enough to pick up moisture for the Iekka Islands!
</p>
<p>
	Eventually as we head even further south the Wrro Plateau loosens its death-grip upon the place
	and things start getting greener. Though not much later on we meet with the Iekkas and then
	we shall move on to Xrij.
</p>
<h2 id="Phiabsia">Phiabsia</h2>
<p>
	Phiabsia is a connective strip of land that connects Bivu with the rest of Sewb. The entire
	land is fairly low-lying and generally all under 1000 m in height, though there are some
	sparce mountains here and there. It fades into the Sewb/Saesson shore to the north, Yiwgg
	to the west and the Sakkarsti Territories to the south.
</p>
<h3 id="Alase">Alase and the Jedu Forest</h3>
<aside>
	<h4>Trolls and the Environment</h4>
	<p>
		A curious relationship exists between Trolls and the Alternian ecosystems. They are not as
		predisposed to wantonly exploit it like humans do; nevertheless they do view it not as a 
		system but as a simple background that can be changed at will. What prevents them from doing
		so is their own special set of bureaucracy stemming from inter-caste interactions.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Going down the northeast coast of Phiabsia we make it past the River Psseggo, through miles
	and miles of steamy rainforest. The vegetation here is just as vital to the overall biomass
	as any given rainforest; overall, the soil quality is very poor because of the large amount of
	leaching that exists in places with such incredible rainfall. Nonetheless this place is quite
	vibrant, albeit tamed by recent Troll incursions.
</p>
<p>
	Not much changes as we head down closer to the equator, and at last we find our way to 
	Cutis, a homely, small town of 80,000 mainly filled with medium-to-highbloods. From here on in
	we shall head southwest, first down the marked major road that crosses towards the centre of
	Phiabsia.
</p>
<p>
	The trip yields unrelenting forest, though it is not the most persistent of biomes; here the
	trees are thinner as they attempt to suck up as many nutrients as possible. Generally, you 
	can see quite a distance into this huge forest, with visibility going all the way up to 100 m
	before the last lines of sight end at a tree. The trees here are not as flood resistant as those
	in the Maets Swamp further to the west, where the silty, poor soil makes plants evolve extremely
	mold-resistant wood. Trolls have long realised that this is a wonderful property of wood, and 
	as the Maets lies between the two major centres of population Sibila (the "summerhouse of 
	the Subjuggulators", 1.5 million, 50% of them are purple-bloods) and Alase ("Sibila for the 
	poor man" or "yet another transit station", 2.1 million), Maets wood is becoming increasingly
	harder to find, to the point where some environmental protection groups have sprang up to
	protect it. The results were… <em>interesting</em>, to say the least.
</p>
<p>
	But speaking of Alase, we have arrived at the town! Alase slumbers as a fairly large town of
	two million, as stated earlier, and has a "cooperative relationship" with Sibila (as in, one
	won't immediately smash the other to bits in one of those hyper-realistic big war games that
	occasionally pop up). With the delta of the Flemmaenfaw River feeding it, it manages to eke a 
	living out of generating measly amounts of HEP – about 7 to 8 GW (or in the redundant but
	traditional units, 61 to 70 billion kilowatt-hours per year), enough to maybe power 
	one district out of five) and having altogether too many universities (seventeen in a 1300 km²
	area) for its average education level (Terran equivalent: 1 year in university).
</p>
<p>
	Now that we visited Alase, we shall veer southeast and see the Jedu Forest close-up. We shall
	leave the marked roads and visit the Forest through some smaller roads.
</p>
<p>
	The Jedu Forest is a tamed, semi-open forest with maximal visibility varying from 80 m to 
	horizon (so basically you can see the sky sometimes, even if you're looking straight ahead).
	The trees here are generally subdued and not the super-tall monster trees that you recall back
	on the other side of the Yiwgg Sea; most of them do not exceed 40 m in height and the median
	height is 15 m – they still look like your average oak or birch forest and you'd feel mildly
	Hundred-Acre Wood-ish walking around it, though no signs of talking yellow bears with a red
	shirt has ever been recorded in the Jedu, and it is <em>far</em> larger than the Hundred-Acre.
</p>
<p>
	A large portion of the trees exist nearer to the coast and rivers of course; closer to the vast
	Wrro Plateau and away from those sources of water the forest thins out almost completely into
	open forest that house many strange beasts that will find life well here. These include things
	that look similar to foxes and wolves, but they are generally about 20% bigger and closer to the
	"terrifyingly big" end of the scale than what you may see on Earth. Even the herbivores, 
	for example three-toed equinoids, bolt at 90 km/h and are 3 m tall – so don't ride one.
</p>
<!-- 
	Yes I realize that they're usually "hoofbeasts" but we're trying to be <em>scientific</em> here!
-->
<p>
	In the center of the forest there is a lake, Lake Nsegom, hosting a city, Morana. The River
	Atande flows through the 
	both the lake and the city, and all of them are quite blue. Morana is particularly full of 
	blue and indigo-bloods, which extends the city into the lake (it's freshwater, so they don't 
	like it, but it's tolerable), and the populace is generally quite snobbish and difficult, even
	when the general level of difficulty of Trolls is taken into account.
</p>
<p>
	Further towards the east the Forest fades to the Necchos Swamp as it nears the Saesson Shore,
	but we're not heading in that direction, instead, we veer towards the west again, and 
	visit another wetland: the Efegle Marshes.
</p>
<h3 id="Efegle">The Efegle Marshes and Ipsown</h3>
<p>
	Efegle was the name of a smallish county that used to occupy this marsh, and the marsh got its
	name from this small county. <!--Don't say anything about its resemblance to the Everglades.-->
	It's much like your standard marshland: everything is low-lying, with maximal elevation not
	exceeding 1 m, and only stunted trees grow in the practically-fluid soil that exists in the 
	space as the murky, muddy water that seemingly occupies the same space as the liquid. Mangroves
	are occasionally found but even they found trouble reaching down to the firmer subsoil; the
	weathering profile is over 150 m down, making the marsh literally thicker than Minecraft worlds!
</p>
<p>
	(As a parenthetical, the county was eventually taken over by the marsh. What a dramatic 
	reversal of the things that happened to a certain other marsh here.)
</p>
<aside>
	<h4>Alternian Evolution</h4>
	<p>
		In Alternia, bird-like insects come from insects, and therefore have four legs and two
		wings for a total of six limbs. Most Alternian insects also have eight legs. Though there
		could be as few as four or as many as fifty.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	This thick marsh means that large animals are unlikely to last very long around here, owing to
	the liquid ground that covers most of the territory. Composing a major part of animal life in 
	the Efegle are insects. These insects are almost completely predatory; with very few exceptions
	most of them eat other insects, as well as their four-legged birdlike cousins. The birds and 
	a tiny minority of the insects eat off the berries and hard fruit that come off of the trees,
	fruit that are well-sheltered against the rot and the 100% humidity here, so they have
	exceedingly hard beaks/can-openers!
</p>
<p>
	The remaining life there are generally arboreal and silvicultural, tending to the trees that 
	grow explosively in the land. Biodiversity is low however because of the instability of the 
	ecosystem – a lack of soil really puts a limit on things! The bulk of the biodiversity – even
	more so than that on rainforests, are the tens and tens of thousands of bacteria genera, you
	know the things that you never <em>see</em> or even feel much about when eradicating. They
	really don't count as biodiversity.
</p>
<p>
	The swamp seems to stretch forever, but eventually it ends after crossing a very short river.
	It dies down into regular forest, the land starts to become harder and walkable again, and
	after a handful of hours of moving around you'll find a city: Ipsown.
</p>
<p>
	Ipsown is another one of those little port-guard cities that dot the Yiwgg Sea. The city is 
	small, only home to about 100,000 Trolls, and it is associated with Jombox further up to the 
	northwest. This association brings itself good things and bad things. While it receives a lot
	of funding from its neighbor across the Sea, it also finds itself having to adopt the official
	religion of the Subjuggulators and ensure at least <sup>2</sup>&#x2044;<sub>3</sub> of the city
	is at least subscribed to that system of belief or at least look like they are. That's why the 
	city is so thinly populated – those who don't explicitly profess that belief were driven away 
	or even culled!
</p>
<aside>
	<h4>Pollution statistics</h4>
	<p>
		As of −1 PD, the area around Ipsown has received an average of
		1.3 kL m<sup>−2</sup> <span class="altYr">year</span> of the liquid. That's 1300 litres, 
		on every square metre, every <span class="altYr">year</span>.
	</p>
</aside>
<aside>
	<h4>Subjuggulator subdivisions</h4>
	<p>
		Some subjuggulators don't like this wanton waste of elixir. That's one of the things that 
		makes the religion, in reality controlled by the Empress, more "alive".
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	That same religion has less than ideal effects on the environment too. The sacraficial drinks
	are acidic and filled with carbon dioxide, and while plants relish on this gas they can't take
	it at the high concentration that the drink bottles it in, so they generally look droopy and 
	dead. The acidic liquid makes the local pH drop below 6.5 when its surroundings usually hang
	around in the 7.0 to 7.3 range, making aquatic life have a hard time suriviving. Free sugar
	means an infestation of insects and other small animals, and makes them strong enough that 
	they drive away small non-insect populations, destroying the food chain above the insects. 
	The few trees that dare take root in the nutrient-starved soil are battered
	by juggling clubs, making them bruised and termite-infested. Although there are signs of life
	adapting to this strange microenvironment – especially the insects! – they are slow on the
	evolution and even now overall biomass per unit area is up to 70% less than the surrounding 
	land.
</p>
<p>
	Ultimately, Ipsown is a bit weird and perhaps unhealthy to live in long-term. It might be 
	expedient to leave now and see what comes beyond.

<figure class="minor bigger">
	<img src="img/Map_Yiwgg.jpg"/>
	<figcaption>The above map, zoomed in on Yiwgg.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Yiwgg is the cinch that divides the Yiwgg Sea from the Baeta Gulf. Because of its constrictive
	properties, it makes the land nearby slightly less fertile and drier. It has been hypothesized
	that Yiwgg might be one of the oldest parts of the world in existence – a craton, the first 
	lumps of land to rise from the sea due to the process of vulcanism, after icy comets and
	atmospheric water fell and created the oceans. These are called continental cratons and there
	are equivalents on Earth too – Ur, a protocontinent that currently makes up parts of India,
	Madagascar and Australia, is one such craton.
</p>
<p>
	In any case this small land fared a lot better than Ur did, managing to remain all in one 
	piece, rather than being fractured and broken across an entire ocean. Certainly, exposed
	rock outcroppings on Yiwgg is significantly older than similar ones back in Phiabsia – about 
	2.8 <span class="altYr">Ga</span> as opposed to the 2.2 <span class="altYr">Ga</span>
	of rocks of similar depth nearby. Whether that really means that Yiwgg rock is really older than
	rocks nearby, or that Yiwgg used to be a protocontinent and is now a craton, is another question
	altogether.

<figure class="minor">
	<img src="img/NetworkTopology-Star.png"/>
	<figcaption>
		An example of a star topology. The layout of Yiwgg City utilizes this topology.
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	We head over to the city that shares the same name as the entire peninsula. Overall the land
	is pleasant, with dry winds coming over from the east and a weak but feelable wet breeze from
	the west. The entire place, being so close to the equator, is usually drenched with rain.
</p>
<p>
	Most of the place, biome-wise, the entire low edge of the peninsula is covered by a uniform 
	piece of grassland and open forest, but as we head closer to the City the climate becomes
	drier and drier, and grasslands start to dominate. The shore also become shallower as the Sea
	becomes narrower the further west we go.
</p>
<p>
	At last when the shore abruptly turns south then east, we have reached Yiwgg City. The city 
	holds 5 million people, most of them being tradesmen or similar jobs. There used to be some 
	fishing industry here but then a nasty accident with an oil spill nearby put a stop to that
	about 50 years ago. Other industries that happen in Yiwgg include other light industries, 
	especially in terms of manufacturing small home utilities, as well as some shipping and other
	logistics systems. The city isn't much of a travel hub however – Asiddum, across the strait,
	is responsible for that.
</p>
<!--br class="push"/>
<figure class="minor">
	<img src="img/Speaker_Icon.svg.png" class="lowres"/>
	<figcaption>The actual structure of Yiwgg City, however, resembles this figure.</figcaption>
</figure-->
<p>
	Yiwgg City is arranged in the "star" formation – a central hub with tendrils of suburbs coming
	out of it (see figure). At first glance though, it doesn't look like a star; the "hub" is at
	one end of the city (the tip of the peninsula) and is the westernmost part of the city, and 
	the "urbanness" of the city decreases strictly from west to east. In terms of land use zoning,
	the boundaries are drawn between "urban", "suburban" and "rural" areas much like how one might
	draw the symbol for the speaker, where the speaker itself is the CBD, and each of the "waves"
	coming out of the "speaker" are boundaries between increasingly rural areas.
</p>
<p>
	This is both predictable and surprising when its shape is considered: on the one hand,
	the way how the city is constrained on three sides by the shore <em>would</em> make the
	central business district be at the very tip of the peninsula and hence pushing all the other
	parts of the city back landwards, but on the other hand, the fact that the CBD is at the 
	very, <em>very</em> tip of the peninsula is unusual, as one might expect it to be at least
	somewhat residential (think of the view!)
</p>
<p>
	Nevertheless, there it is, a huge city with a strange structure. Its people, on the other
	hand, are are entirely bog-standard and pretty scary too, so let's take a hop, skip  and jump
	and explore the rest of the peninsula, especially the gently-sloped centre of the craton.
</p>
<h3 id="Upakxe">Mt. Upakxe</h3>
<p>
	In three words, the Yiwgg Peninsula can be called "a bit dry". It's dry for a handful of 
	reasons:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		It is on the far west of the continent in a continent that normally has winds blowing from
		east to west, and land makes winds dry;
	</li>
	<li>Even the winds from the west are squeezed of its moisture via Bivu on the west;</li>
	<li>
		It hasn't got a lot of lakes to evaporate off of and make its own rain, and even if there
		were the lake would disappear in short order.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In other words, the place is a little bit like coastal Persia – rain doesn't come frequently
	or in large amounts, but fortunately due to the large amount of rivers and also the sea,
	that isn't so much of a problem all the time. Most of the time this is because of the central
	peak, Mt. Upakxe, or as it is sometimes referred to as, Majescule Upakxe and its secondary peak
	Minuscule Upakxe.
</p>
<p>
	Maj. Upakxe is 1992.35 m tall, and its sister is 1942.58 m tall – the twin peaks are 
	occasionally referred to as one because the two are fairly similar. Nevertheless, though they are
	much the same in terms of geology and climate, they host slightly different flora and fauna –
	most notably a small stick-insect that has a variable number of segments, but ranges from 
	30 ~ 50 in Majescule Upakxe and 40 ~ 55 in Miniscule Upakxe!
</p>
<p>
	These two peaks influence the rest of the subcontinent in a relatively simple manner: they
	make the whole place slightly wetter by interrupting wind coming in from both sides, making 
	the place slightly wetter than what it is. This makes the land slightly greener, which it
	entirely needs to be, because being a desert is no good.
</p>
<p>We then exit the subcontinent on the south, and see the rest of what this map can offer us:</p>

	<img src="img/Map_Sakkar.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"/>
	<figcaption>
		A map of the south Sakkarsti Territories. The Fetlen, Sitrix and Omfmaw Subterritories are
		depicted.
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Generally known as the Sakkarsti Territories because of the capital that has
	<i lang="la">de jure</i> administration over the said Territory, this part is generally 
	quite flyover country for the most part – it is the mainland equivalent of the Iekka Islands, 
	but since it is land there is considerably fewer exciting things to talk about and basically 
	it's just a connector between Yiwgg and the far end of the Iekkas.
</p>
<p>
	As a brief overview, the Sakkarsti Territories are cut latitudinally by the Rivers Lixitu, 
	Drageen, Fetlen and Sitrix (sometimes hypercorrected into Sitrich). Each river separates weakly
	the ecosystem on the opposite sides of the banks; though there is some intermingling they still
	posit a divider in the fauna if not the flora (whose pollen laughs in the face of such mundane
	terrain difficulties).
</p>
<p>
	Though there are divisions, and those divisions shape the political boundaries within the 
	Sakkarsti Territories, the ecosystem in general does not care much about these boundaries, so
	much of Territories remain homogeneous. The climate follows a gentle gradient from a little dry
	to somewhat dry, the former being the dry blast that forms the Djesima Steppe – an artefact of 
	the Wrro Plateau – and the latter being the general high-pressure zone that dissipates clouds 
	which appear on virtually all planets.
</p>
<p>
	As for the local inhabitants: as said earlier, they are subdivided by checking which side of the
	river they are on. From north to south, these are: Lixitu, Drageen, Fetlen, Sitrix and Omfmaw,
	with Omfmaw being the name of the subdivision that contains land that is south of all four 
	rivers (it gives the name of the steppe that covers a large amount of that particular
	subterritory). Each territory has its own little "thing" that separates it from the others:
</p>
<h4>Lixitu</h4>
<p>
	Lixitu and its regional capital Djase both are somewhat agrarian in form, being one of the
	fairly wet places here.
	The people are often lower in blood caste here than elsewhere. Compounded with the obvious fact
	that highbloods concentrate on shores and in the sea", places like Alssia and Cchiohi are almost
	<sup>7</sup>&#x2044;<sub>12</sub><sup>th</sup>s Trolls with Þ &lt; 0 (orange- and red-bloods). 
</p>
<p>
	It's the poorest of the five in the Sakkarsti Territories, because of its agricultural nature.
	Unlike similar countries here on Earth though, it makes enough food to keep a surplus. 
	Strangely, the subterritory loses a couple tens of thousands of Trolls every year, more than
	any other place on Alternia.
</p>
<h4>Drageen</h4>
<p>
	Drageen generally deals in technology, and it also holds the territorial capital of Sakkar. The
	place also does some farming and other agricultural work, which takes up more than 20% of all
	land in Drageen. (The machinery factories take up a much smaller amount of space, of course.)
	Of note in Drageen is the proliferation of academic institutions, more than anywhere else on the
	planet.
</p>
<h4>Fetlen</h4>
<p>
	A fine place, perhaps maybe a bit boring for some people, Fetlen has a minor racing culture as
	well as a slightly less dining culture. Perhaps "racing" may not be boring, but that's the story
	that its population and its environment tell: an apparently endless grassland with very open 
	forests, the occasional town and cottage with towns being few and far between. It doesn't even
	have a single town with population greater than 100,000.
</p>
<p>
	It does have one regular racing circuit and its road network has a special route that closes
	on occasion to host a racing show that runs once every six years. A racing circuit where all you
	see is grass, tree and cow for miles and miles and miles… riveting.
</p>
<h4>Sitrix</h4>
<p>
	Sitrix is wet, the wettest of all five territories, with an annual rainfall of about 1 350 mm.
	This would make it great for farming but that's not what this territory is about. Instead, it
	focuses itself on a variety of things, and all in all it's the most balanced of the five. Well,
	maybe it's a bit into racing and fashion too, like Fetlen to the north, but not to such a large
	degree – no enormous racing track and few exhibition centers. It has some rarish creatures, but
	they are not endemic to the location, and none are at risk of extinction. They would resemble
	butterflies and moths – but like everything else in Alternia, they're supersized: about 30 to 
	40 cm in full span.
</p>
<h4>Omfmaw</h4>
<p>
	A silly-sounding place with a silly-acting populace, this bit of dry land contains a significant
	proportion of comedians compared to anywhere else. However, that is not its only speciality;
	its connection with the Iekka Islands to the west make it, and especially its regional capital
	Kent, exceptionally rich, at least in terms of the Sakkarsti Territories. It's so rich that it
	can just buy water from other places – though it lies at the upper edge of the horse latitudes,
	a little extra water never hurt anybody.
</p>
<p>
	The place is fairly mountainous but not as rugged as Sitrix. Its highest mountain, Stee, is
	965 m tall and is generally not tall enough to do much at this latitude. All that bumpiness is 
	for naught!
</p>
<br class="push"/>
<p>
	And with that our journey here is complete, and we head east towards Xrij, Saesson and the 
	Wrro Plateau…
