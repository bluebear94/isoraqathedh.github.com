<h1 id="Title">Introduction</h1>
<p>
	Before you read this article, you must remember some of these extremely important points:
</p>
<aside>
	<h2>PD and RD</h2>
	<p>
		Please note that PD and RD are not actually used as time-keeping dates in the Troll society,
		much like how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present">BP</a> is not used
		as a time-keeping date in our society.
	</p>
</aside>
<dl>
	<dt>"Present Day", "now"</dt>
	<dd>
		This term refers to the time just prior to the Vast Glub, a truly colossal catastrophe where
		the entire race of Trolls are wiped out completely. Times after this, especially in the far
		future, is terribly speculative.
	</dd>
	<dt><var>n</var>&nbsp;PD</dt>
	<dd>
		This syntax marks a definite date before the present day, as defined above. <var>n</var> is
		the number of Alternian years (<em>not</em> Earth years) that have passed. 
		0 PD is the date of the Vast Glub. Note, like RD below, this number is always negative.
	</dd>
	<dt>"Recent"</dt>
	<dd>
		This term refers to the time prior to Troll influence over the Alternian system, as defined
		later. Before the Recent Date, there has been no terraforming, no genetic engineering,
		no other anthropogenic (Trollogenic?) factors involved in the locations where Trolls are 
		extant &ndash; no Trolls full stop, most of the time. 
	</dd>
	<dt><var>n</var>&nbsp;RD</dt>
	<dd>
		This syntax marks a definite date before the Recent Date, as defined above. Again,
		<var>n</var> is the number of Alternian years that has passed since the epoch of the RD. 
		The epoch of the Recent Date, 0&nbsp;RD, is 
		defined to be &minus;12000&nbsp;PD. Again, in most cases, RD numbers are always less than
		12,000, and usually RD dates are not used when RD is positive.
	</dd>
	<dt><var>n</var> thousand years ago, <var>n</var> ka, or <var>n</var> kya</dt>
	<dd>
		These syntaxes are exactly equal to "<var>&minus;n</var> RD". To reduce confusion, if used,
		<var>n</var> must be no less than 100, otherwise "<var>&minus;n</var> RD" or 
		"(<var>&minus;n</var> &minus; 12000) PD" will be used.
	</dd>
	<dt><var>n</var> million years ago, <var>n</var> Ma, or <var>n</var> Mya</dt>
	<dt><var>n</var> billion years ago, <var>n</var> Ga, <var>n</var> Gya, or <var>n</var> Bya</dt>
	<dd>
		These syntaxes are exactly equal to "<var>&minus;n</var> RD", multiplied by the appropriate
		factor.
	</dd>
	<dt>"Year", "day", "radius", "diameter", "atmosphere" etc.</dt>
	<dd>
		Unless specified, all of the above refer to Earth-based units, such as Earth year, Earth
		day and so on.
	</dd>
	<dt><span class="altYr">year, thousand years, million years, billion years</span></dt>
	<dt><span class="altYr">y, yr, kyr, Myr, Gyr</span></dt>
	<dt><span class="altYr">a, ka, Ma, Ga</span></dt>
	<dd>
		Any year-related word rendered in <span class="altYr">small caps</span> will always be with 
		respect to Alternian years, <em>not</em> Earth years. All of the above refer to time
		intervals.
	</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	Furthermore, all numbers are accurate up to three significant figures or the nearest integer
	(context suffices to distinguish the two) unless noted otherwise (which includes figures such
	as 1.3). All numbers prefixed with "about", "around" and other such words have no significant
	zeros.
