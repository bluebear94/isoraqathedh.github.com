			This continent is Australia #2 of Alternia. Its relative isolation from the other
			three continents means that it harbours strange lifeforms unknown to the Mainland.
			Unfortunately the gap between it and <a href="Gazetteer_QtoZ.html#S">Sewb</a>
			is a little bit on the short side, meaning that it isn't as wet as Sewb. The foreignness
			is also reflected in the names – Quuag-dulle names are significantly longer in both
			character and syllable count.

<h1 id="R">R</h1>
<p>
	Like J, the design of the Alternian orthography has made it so that toponyms never start with an
	R in Alternia, as Rs only appear after consonants cannot be complete syllable onsets themselves.
	Unlike J and Z however, Rs can <em>appear</em> to head words if it succeeds a weak enough
	consonant. What constitutes a "weak enough consonant" however is not relevant to the discussion
	here.
