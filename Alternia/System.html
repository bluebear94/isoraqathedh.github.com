	In stark contrast to the Galaxy, the Alternian System is a bustling place, with stars every
	which way and coming in a denser packing than the ones in our solar neighborhood. There are
	many, many stars with planets and planetoids orbiting them, which has implications to the Trolls
	and whoever (un)fortunate enough to meet them.
</p>
<h1 id="PrimasolEnvNbhd">Primasol, its Environment and its Neighborhood</h1>
<aside>
	<h3>Troll Temperament</h3>
	<p>
		The Trolls have long been conquest-like in its demeanor, hoping to have all for some unknown
		and probably non-existent end.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	The Alternian System, unlike the galaxy, is relatively filled with stars. This relative fullness
	is not unexpected, as the system has been near the core for almost as long as it was formed; 
	it means that the Trolls have very little conciousness that their environment is actually quite
	small.
</p>
<p>
	This is a factor that allows them to push out in the first place; should they have learnt
	that there are planets that they would never be able to reach even with all the determination in
	the world, they would have given up. Instead, they only have to conquer one galaxy in order
	to feel like they have conquered "Everything" with a capital E, and their push is hence 
	magnified.
</p>
<h2 id="AlternianSystemDetails">Details on the Neighborhood</h2>
<aside>
	<h3>Names and the size thereof</h3>
	<p>
		Troll names have 6 letters, locations 8, weapons 10, and most everything else 12. Suffixes
		and numbers do not count in the letter count.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	The closest star to Alternia, named Visgarto, is approximately 1 parsec away from Alternia's 
	parent star. (Incidentally, Alternia's star is not named; it's just 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autological_word">"Star"</a>, like we might
	call ours "Sun". In this article, we will refer to this star as "Primasol".) Like Proxima
	Centauri, Visgarto is part of a multiple star system, but it 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star">only has one companion,</a>
	and it's the primary. As the binary star system does not contain any planets
	at all this star is of relatively less importance to the Trolls.
</p>
<!-- Fact: "Primasol" sounds like some kind of drug that Katniss might have to take. -->
<p>
	Slightly more important to the Trolls is Baspilog, which is about 8.3&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.06&nbsp;pc
	away from Primasol. The star just prior to the Vast Glub is an M8V, but is edging on to being
	an M9V, with an effective surface temperature only half of the Sun's and a downright miniscule
	portion of its light level. The small star hosts a single planet, approximately three-tenths
	of the mass of Earth, which is used as a secondary breeding ground and a
	<i lang="la">de facto</i> head of office. (Putting the head of office in Alternia itself is 
	too risky; only the royal palace is placed there, mainly as a symbol.)
</p>
<!--
	Apparently, putting a superweapon capable of putting an end to all Trolls in the Universe in the
	self-same place is <em>not</em> too dangerous or risky.
-->
<p>
	Elsewhere in the neighborhood, most inhabitable planets are populated with people who are either
	very much chums with the Trolls or those who learn to <em>look like</em> they were very much 
	chums with the Trolls. This location tends to be quite extravagant, as can be expected, as this
	is pretty much the centre of the Empire after all.
</p>
<h2 id="PrimasolEnvironment">The Primasol Environment</h2>
<p>
	The Primasol Environment is defined to be the volume of space where the solar wind of Primasol
	can successfully overcome the resistance given by the interstellar medium (the Earth/Sun 
	equivalent is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere">heliosphere</a>). This 
	environment is considered the "home territory" of the Trolls, and almost every part of it is 
	known like the back of a hand, although that particular job is very easy as it turns out that
	like many other places in any given Universe, the Primasol Environment is as close to empty as
	it gets.
</p>
<p>
	The Primasol Environment is roughly a sphere, squatter on one end and elongated on the other,
	with an average radius of about 130&nbsp;AU. Excluding Primasol itself and the major planets, 
	this part of the Alternian system has a combined mass of about
	<sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>22</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>9</sub> Earth masses.
	Only minor planets, including comets, asteroids and their satellites are found in this part
	of the system. 
</p>
<p>
	Around the 50&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;70&nbsp;AU zone is a very loose collection of small bodies not
	unlike the Kuiper Belt of ours, but this belt is unnamed because it is much looser than the
	Kuiper Belt; indeed, its consistency is not much more than the consistency of the Scattered
	Disc. Nevertheless this belt constitutes virtually all the mass of the Alternian System outside
	of the star and its planets, as there is also no Asteroid Belt-like analogue in the Alternian
	System either.
</p>
<h2 id="Primasol">Primasol</h2>
<p>
	Primasol is quite different from other stars. For one thing, it is one of the very sparse stars
	in the Galaxy that are of a hotter spectral class: it is a G0V, with indications that it will
	slowly evolve to G0IV-V in a very short astronomical order. 
</p>
<aside>
	<h3>Number zone</h3>
	<p>
		A star size of <var>n</var> M<sub>sol</sub> will have the star's lifetime equal to 
		10 × <var>n</var><sup>−3</sup>. Hence the life expectancy of Primasol is
		10 × 1.1<sup>−3</sup> =&nbsp;7.51&nbsp;billion years.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Primasol is 120% the size of our sun, with about 10% more mass and 25% less total life
	expectancy. The star is about 4.3 to 4.4 billion years old, with the various planets forming
	slightly later – Alternia is formed about 4.311 ± 0.003 billion years ago. Even though Alternia
	and Primasol are younger than the Earth and the Sun, they are when compared to their total life
	expectancy older than Terra/Sol.
</p>
<p>
	The star is very much similar to other stars of its mass, especially our Sun. It is a yellow
	dwarf that mainly emits light in the visible light range (though when compared to the Sun,
	Primasol emits more light on the blue end of the scale than our sun does, and is also brighter).
	Its surface temperature is around 5500&nbsp;K, which is very much similar to the Sun's, almost
	to the point of insigificance.
</p>
<p>
	Primasol is also rare because, like most large stars, it is solitary, having absorbed or 
	blown away their younger, smaller companions early in its life. This also means that planets
	have an easier time stably orbiting the star in question, and guess what we are doing next.
</p>

	This section will look at the seven planets of the Alternian System, excluding (in the count
	and in the section)
	Alternia itself, which will be dealt with in the next chapter.

</figure-->
<p>
	Abresham is a tiny cinder of heavy metal and solid rock orbiting Primasol in tight yet highly
	eccentric orbit. Due to a lack of an appreciable atmosphere its surface is 
	baked on one side and frozen on the other, and it is also tidelocked, meaning that only one side
	faces the sun (in other words, an Abresham
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time">sidereal day</a> is exactly equal to an 
	Abresham tropical year). The planet's dayside has a temperature of 450&nbsp;±&nbsp;12&nbsp;K and
	its nightside 160 ± 13 K.
</p>
<p>
	It has no appreciable atmosphere to speak of; whatever paltry amount the planet <em>can</em> 
	attain with its feeble outgassing is violently stripped away from it by the solar wind. It 
	<em>does</em> have a magnetic field protecting it, but its strength, which is measured to be 
	about 1&nbsp;034
	<span class="measErr">
		<span class="plus">+31.5</span>
		<span class="minus">−13.4</span>
	</span> p<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)">T</a>,
	is simply too weak for any sort of "protection" to be effective.
</p>
<aside>
<h3>Number Zone</h3>
<p>
	The value "53 days" is not arbitrary. This value is derived from
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion">Kepler's third law,</a>
	which is reproduced below.
</p>
<img src="img/keppm3l.png" alt="P² = (4π²a³)/(G(m + m_p))" width="150" class="eq"/>
<p>
	Here, <var>P</var> represents the period or year of the planet, <var>a</var> represents the 
	semi-major axis of the planet (roughly equal to its apoapsis), <var>m</var> is the mass of the
	parent and <var>m<sub>p</sub></var> represents the mass of the body in question.
</p>
</aside>
<p>
	It completes one orbit around Primasol (and hence one rotation) in about 53 days, but it
	precesses and nutates quite strongly, allowing more than half of its surface to the see the sun.
	A lot of the intervening location is still quite desolate due to the absolute lack of 
	atmosphere, but a lot of early Troll expeditions stay here for its ability to simulate a 
	semblance of diurnal rotation.
</p>
<p>
	Due to its lack of atmosphere and geological activity, this planet is one of the 
	so-called "dead planets", which are planets that cannot support or exhibit any large change
	by itself and is in essence a singular floating lump of rock and metal zipping around Primasol.
	As can also be expected, the planet is pock-marked with many craters large and small. One of the
	largest, named only "Abresham 1", is around 810 km across and is located around the 35°S line.
	Since it is on the night side, the bottom of the crater has minimal amounts of water ice.
</p>
<p>
	All in all, this planet is a desolate, almost uninhabited, and practically unwelcome lump of 
	rock that can get in the way. The reason why it isn't gone though, is that it coughs up enough
	useful metals even recently to sate the alarming amounts of metal that goes into building ships
	and such like.
</p>
<h2 id="Pelvicot">Pelvicot</h2>
<p>
	Pelvicot is another dinky planet, similar in many ways to Abresham. Due to these inferior
	qualities though (including its classification as a "dead" planet), the planet is very much 
	similar to Abresham, including much of its inner composition, general rock makeup and thin 
	atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
	However, its year, 156.1 ± 0.3 days, is quite different from its day, which is 12.5 ± 1.1 days
	long. As can be seen from the long day, Pelvicot is clearly already severly affected by tidal
	drag, but it will not be able to wind down into a tidelocked rotation before the star goes
	red giant. 
</p>
<p>
	Also unlike Abresham is its atmosphere, which, while thin (about 0.04 atm), is still substantial
	enough to 
	make some significant differences in temperature moderation. Coupled with its slow but certain
	spin, this makes the difference between day temperature and night temperature much less extreme:
	the hottest temperature recorded is 323.3 ± 5.2 K and the lowest is 191.4 ± 4.1 K. It also has
	an axial tilt, which is measured to be around 10° 45&prime; ± 14&prime;.
</p>
<p>
	Pelvicot is otherwise quite insignificant. Despite the atmosphere it is still not a place where
	liquid water can exist under most circumstances, and hence the planet is pretty much useless to
	the Trolls in terms of inhabitation (at least, to the upper class, and who other would be more
	important than them?) However, there is a significant population here that
	until recently served to mine and gather resources. Because it's so much further from Primasol
	than Abresham, Pelvicot has lots more lighter resources that one may find, including iron,
	silicon in the ground, and oxygen and carbon extractable from the atmospehre, in addition to the
	heavier things like lanthanum, tungsten, titanium, platinum and gold.
</p>
<aside>
	<h3>The Pelvicot Expedition</h3>
	<p>
		The Pelvicot expedition was quite harrowing. The first batch of Trolls that arrived have
		all died, and out of the next batch of 20, only one made it back home alive; he was 
		unceremoniously killed and the germs on him taken for analysis. Despite there being 39 
		deaths, only one funeral was held – for Buther Genpis, the sole Troll with blood type J of
		the lot.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Immigrant Trolls aside, this planet is practically lifeless, with little  more complex than 
	small bacteria and the occasional virus arriving from outer space eking out their own little
	existences on the surface and underground. These lifeforms however have had made their mark on
	Troll history, making the first Trolls (which are undifferentiated in the history textbooks
	save one) terribly sick and usually dead.
</p>
<p>
	Pelvicot has a small moonlet called Arsimate, which is so small it is unable to pull itself 
	together to form a spheroid. The moon measures about 10 km × 8 km × 9 km, has a shape similar to
	a twisted kitchen sponge, and one side faces Pelvicot at all times. There is very little else
	to talk about it, and even to the Trolls it is merely a little annoyance to get over with as
	fast as possible.
</p>
<h2 id="Pebahars">Pebahars</h2>
<p>
	The planet orbits about 0.8 AU from Primasol, giving it an orbital period of 227 days. It 
	manages one day in 37 hours, 18 minutes and 9.4 seconds ± 0.4 seconds, and sports a rather 
	sizeable atmosphere, about 0.4 times that of Earth's.
</p>
<p>
	Pebahars has an actively spinning core of iron and nickel, which allows it to have an 
	appreciable magnetic field, although it is only one-tenth of that of Earth's (about 6,400 nT).
	Adding to the fact that its thick atmosphere allows it to normalize
	temperature swings around the place, this planet is almost inhabitable. However, the temperature
	in Pebahars is just a teensy bit too cool for Trolls to live in comfortably: 241.5 ± 2.7 K at
	maximum and 184.1 ± 1.0 K at minimum.
</p>
<p>
	Interestingly, this value is actually cooler than Alternia, which has a temperature range that
	is slightly higher than that of Pebahars! This odd fact is easily explained though: Alternia has
	a very thick atmosphere, which you will find <a href="Planet.html#">later on</a>, is about 
	2.5 atmospheres. This basically means that the heat that heats Alternia is mostly from internal
	factors, and not external factors. This is the major difference between Pebahars and
	Alternia: Pebahars has very little active volcanism and other tectonic activity going on.
</p>
<p>
	Why less tectonic activity? Remember how the planet is half the size of Earth? Well, Earth's 
	already a pretty borderline case for tectonic activity. It's just barely enough to keep chugging
	along for most of its 10-billion-year-old lifetime. Pebahars' mass is much, much smaller than 
	Earth's – as can be seen in the table above, <a href="#PrimasolPlanets">only one-half</a> 
	Earth mass – so it will not be terribly difficult for us to imagine that its "fuel" has long
	since been "burnt out", or in this case, is about to burn out.

	<figcaption>Atmospheric composition of Pebahars</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Anyway, its thick-ish atmosphere is mainly carbon dioxide, with medial amounts of molecular
	oxygen, methane, noble gases and water vapor. The large amount of carbon dioxide does little to
	increase its temperature mainly because there is rather little atmosphere to begin with –
	a similar situation exists with Mars.
</p>
<p>
	Troll influences however have filled this planet up with water to an appreciable extent – about
	90% of the planet's surface area is now underwater, which is not a significant feat, given
	its rather flat topology. Originally, it only had sparce oceans around places where heat from
	within wells up to the top, and these tiny seas manage to wear some of
	the planet down to its low altitude variance. Later on, the Trolls came along and flooded the
	place (the water also has a greenhousing effect, making it self-perpetuating),
	giving it a nice protective layer. Using meteoroids, comets and other space debris, they
	have successfully made the planet the way it is today.
</p>
<p>
	It also has two natural satellites, called Uirespai and Toviansa. The two moons are small, but 
	not as small as Arsimate, though still not big enough to attain hydrostatic equilibrium. The 
	two moons have an average radius of 60 km and 30 km respectively, and have an orbital resonance
	of 16:31 with randomization time of about 3000 years. The two moons are often used as storage
	space.
</p>
<h2 id="Vemapaid">Vemapaid</h2>
<p>
	Vemapaid is just a teensy bit smaller than Pebahars, and as such, it is easier to describe it
	by constrasting it with Pebahars.
</p>
<p>
	Being much, much further away, Vemapaid is cooler than Pebahars, but because it also has a 
	puffier atmosphere of about 0.9 times Earths' worth, it has a moderate temperature range of 
	between 140 K and 230 K – at least, for some measure of "moderate".
</p>
<p>
	Also because of its increased distance from Primasol – it is about seven times further from it
	than Pebahars is – it has a very long orbital period of 13.5 years, or 4,920 days. However, 
	it still has a respectable spin rate, having a rotational period of about 35 h 44 m 23 s ± 1 s.
	This means that there are about 3,300 Vemapaid days in a Vempaid year.
</p>
<aside>
	<h4>Number Zone</h4>
	<p>
		Insolation is related to the inverse square of the distance. A thing twice as far from a 
		light source has light four times as weak.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	The bleak and desolate atmosphere means that most of the water in Vemapaid – which isn't much 
	– is frozen solid. However, it isn't all that bad – the sky is still blue, although usually
	it is a lot darker than the blue on Earth, because of the sheer distance involved – the 
	insolation of Vemapaid is about <sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>50</sub><sup>ths</sup> of Pebahars.
	From space, Vemapaid is a brown-and-white snowy dirtball – the brown is the rock, stained brown
	due to various factors, and the white is the icy seas, small and patchy but kilometres thick and
	usually reaching the sea floor.
</p>
<p>
	Vemapaid has almost lost its internal heat storage, and what little liquid water left at the 
	very bottom of the smaller lakes are shrinking. They won't shrink to nothing though; the ice on
	top will continue to increase the pressure on the water in the deeper oceans until it melts
	again.
</p>
<p>
	There may even be life beneath all that ice, feeding on the dying vents, but no Troll has ever
	been there, or want to be there. It's certain that they will not advance to spacefaring if they 
	exist, even after the end of the Trolls.
</p>
<p>
	Vemapaid has four moons, Arentais, Vigathos, Quenvers and Seintais. Arentais, Vigathos and 
	Quenvers are in a 1:2:4 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance">resonance</a>
	with each other, like three of the four Jovian moons. Unlike those Jovian moons, though,
	Arentais, Vigathos and Quenvers are tiny, dinky and barely spheroidal, and extremely dense,
	made of mainly iron and nickel. Seintais is a moon orbiting much further away, and is bigger,
	less dense and not in resonance with any of the smaller moons orbiting inside.
</p>
<h2 id="Ambispai">Ambispai</h2>
<p>
	Even further away from Primasol lies Ambispai, the biggest planet of them all by far. Weighing
	in about 875 times the size of Earth – about 3 Jupiters – it completes one orbit in
	41.7 years, and one rotation in about 9¼ hours. The planet is much like Jupiter, with swirling
	cloud bands, gusting storms and the bright shade of
	orange-yellow. It also has a small, dim ring system and a large number of moons orbiting it.
</p>
<p>
	The primary aspect of the storms in Ambispai is that they are large and persistent, but not
	localised. These storms are often global and lightning flashes approximately once every fifteen
	minutes. Far below this layer of clouds, where the pressure is greater, the gas becomes
	compressed into a large liquid ocean, and even further below that the liquid becomes further
	compressed into a large solid lump, which is extremely hot from the compression despite its
	state. However, being only a planet the core is still not hot enough for fusion, but it is 
	enough to generate a truly massive magnetic field comparable again to Jupiter's.
</p>
<p>
	To further parallel Jupiter, its atmosphere is also similar: it has lots of hydrogen, some
	helium, and a little bit of methane. However, unlike Jupiter, it also has an abundance of water
	in all three states: floating clouds of vapor in the upper atmosphere, as part of the giant
	liquid ocean and lumps of hail in between those states. The core contains very little water
	however.

	<figcaption>The rings of Ambispai.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Ambispai also has rings. Although they are mainly made of water ice and other relatively
	brighter and shinier materials, they are also very sparse and thin, so they are not particularly
	visible. They are also not bounded by any shepherd moons.
</p>
<p>
	Ambispai's seventy-one moons range from monsters three-quarters the size of Mercury to tiny
	lumps of rock no more than the size of Arsimate. The largest one, named Gorhosck, contains a 
	vast array of climates, and also hosts a sizeable atmosphere, about 1.3 times the one that 
	Earth has! Gorhosck's atmosphere is near-unbreathable to either human or Troll though, and it
	is reasonably certain that it is barren underneath the thick clouds, although the clouds imply
	there is some kind of liquid down there.
</p>
<h2 id="Gransens">Gransens</h2>
<p>
	Gransens is the younger brother of Ambispai, but it is no Saturn. It lacks the ring system that
	Saturn has, and it also has a much more humble collection of moons, although it does contain
	two moons that have modest atmospheres. It also has stronger wids than Ambispai and a much 
	more vibrant cloud banding pattern from dull red to bright yellow.
</p>
<p>
	Gransens orbits once around the sun every 99 years and 9 months – which is quite a coincidence,
	mind you – and has a day of 10 hours, 5 minutes and 30 seconds ± 15 seconds. It has a very 
	dark ring system with a high amount of shepherd moons, which consist of 7 of Gransens's 66
	satellites (compare 4/71 for Ambispai and
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn">5/62</a> for Saturn).
</p>
<p>
	Mind, even though Gransens have more moons than Saturn, most of these moons are unremarkable,
	being tiny lumps of rock dusted with some dark spots. However, four moons have some kind of 
	atmosphere, with two of them being substantial:

		<strong>Alrensed</strong>, Moon 4, has a tenuous atmosphere of about 8 µbar, which is
		around half of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Triton">Triton's</a>.
		This atmosphere is maintained by some outgassing done by tidal action rubbing the inside
		enough to cause eruptions of nitrogen, resulting in a mainly nitrogen atmosphere. It is 
		continually being strippted away by Gransens, but the rate is not far due to Alrensed's
		relatively high mass and its relative distance from the primary.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Pishotga</strong>, Moon 12, has a much more substantial atmosphere – around 
		0.6 mbar, which is more than forty times Triton's! It is kind of a mystery why it has so 
		much atmosphere however. It may be because it orbits so close to Moon 18, which continually
		ferries material from ring T to it via gravitational slingshot (Pishotga and Moon 18 have
		a 1:1 resonance). Ring T has slightly more water and ammonia ice than the others,
		which corroborates the idea: Pishotga's atmosphere is mainly water vapor and ammonia with
		some methane.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	As can be seen from figure 2.6a, Moons 37 and 57 also have atmospheres. However, they are 
	extremely thin, like the ones on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_%28moon%29">Io</a>
	or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_%28moon%29">Europa</a>. Moon 37 gathers its

	it accretes more on its surface than it stores in its atmosphere.

</figure>
<p>
	Gransens has five dirty, sparse, sooty rings made up of mostly silicates and other similarly
	dark and 
	dense material, labeled from innermost to outermost R, S, T, U and V. The rings also contain
	some rough
	ammonia and water ice in varying concentrations, with ring T having the highest concentration
	and ring R having the lowest. There have been some contention whether or not rings T and U 
	should be combined together and form a single ring TU with the Zejongai Gap (also known as 
	Gap TU) in the middle. This has created some rather… <em>interesting</em> battles, as the case
	often is with the Trolls.
</p>
<h2 id="Jarsmisp">Jarsmisp</h2>
<p>
	This is the outermost planet of the Alternian System, and it is a very large planet &ndash;
	over four times the size of the Earth!
</p>
<p>
	No one knows the real reason why Jarsmisp has such a high mass compared to the planets on the
	inside of Ambispai's orbit. There are a few good theories though, which obviously means that
	there is a good old war over it. They include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>The Capture Hypothesis</strong>, being that Jarsmisp is a captured planet from 
		interstellar space a long time ago. This makes quite a bit of sense, but it doesn't quite
		add up everywhere, as certain properties of the planet will indicate;
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>The Scatter Hypothesis</strong>, which states that Jarsmisp <em>did</em> form 
		cis-Ambispai but due to some gravitational perturbution has been shot out of the solar
		system into a wider orbit. This can also explain why the cis-Ambispai planets are so
		titchy and is in line with the planetary properites but it doesn't explain what started the
		perturbution or how Jarsmisp can have such a stable and more-or-less circular orbit, if it 
		had to increase its orbital distance nearly fivefold; and
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>The Second Formation Hypothesis</strong>, which states that Jarsmisp is formed
		<i lang="la">in situ</i> but much later than the other planets. In other words, Jarsmisp
		was formed by distant planets and planetesimals colliding and forming a large beefy thing
		that can be called a planet. This is all well and good and can explain some more of its
		properties, but doesn't explain where did all the mass come from. The distant parts of the
		Alternian system, and more improtantly the estimated total mass of it, apparently indicates
		that this did not happen.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In any case, what we <em>do</em> know about Jarsmisp is that it is pretty Troll-friendly to 
	begin with, perhaps even more so than its home planet.
</p>
<p>
	Jarsmisp is cold, as you may imagine. <em>Quite</em> cold. However, it is not particularly cold,
	with temperatures hovering around 150&nbsp;K. It has a very thick atmosphere, about five or 
	six times that of Earth's, which explains its relatively high temperature. However, it is 
	not as high as you think because there isn't a lot of greenhouse gases to warm up the planet:
	CO<sub>2</sub> would have frozen, and so would most of the water and methane. Jarsmisp's 
	atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, oxygen and noble gases at a roughly equal distribution, with
	near-zero but non-zero amounts of water vapor and methane.
</p>
<p>
	Again, there is until recently minimal (~10%) ocean cover, but the Trolls changed all that
	and now it has over ~95% oceans. The Trolls also managed to raise the level of CO<sub>2</sub>
	to such a degree that the stable temperature is now 260 K instead of 150 K, making it a cold, 
	but not <em>inhospitably</em> cold, place to live.
</p>
<p>
	The planet has a long year though. A very long year. A full 116¼ years, in fact. Not as long as 
	Neptune or other distant planets but still a very long time regardless. It still completes one
	day in about 30:24:45.414 ± 0.014 s, however, daytime and nighttime are not immediately obvious
	because the sun is so faint – the difference between the two is that there is a yellow spot 
	magnitude −21.29 (as a comparison, the Sun's magnitude from Earth is −26.74, and 
	Primasol's apparent magnitude from Alternia is −27.25). This spot is still quite a lot brighter
	than a full moon, but it's still about 250 times weaker than it is on Alternia. The spot is also
	only about
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter">2&prime; 42&Prime;</a> wide, which you
	can compare to the Sun's 32&prime; on Earth.
</p>
<p>
	Even this far away, you can still find that Jarsmisp is not a boring place: there are some 
	form of biomes (sure, they range from very cold to extremely cold but there is still a
	significant difference in rock and ice cover), a pinch of snowfall (sometimes with odd 
	liquids or solids as well such as powdered dry ice) – it can exhibit change. It may be 
	permanent Hel there, but it's not a <em>dead</em>planet.
</p>
<h1 id="OtherNotableBodies">Other notable bodies in the Alternian System</h1>
<p>
	Just like our own solar system, there are a couple of odd things that exist in the Alternian
	system that aren't planets. They are divided into three main parts: cis-Jarsmisp bodies,
	intra-Jarsmisp bodies and trans-Jarsmisp bodies. This means that they exist entirely inside of, 
	entirely within or (<em>not</em> entirely) outside of Jarsmisp's orbit, similar to how our
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Solar_System_body">SSSBs</a> are divided into
	cis- and trans-Neptunian.
</p>
<p>Notable cis-Jarsmisp bodies include:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Anseroi bodies</dt>
	<dd><p>
		This class of objects are basically in scattered orbits all around the inside of the
		orbit of Jarsmisp. They don't have much pattern to them – they have extremely varied 
		inclinations, periods and sizes. Named after Anseroi, the second largest and the 
		first-discovered of the bunch, is about one-third the size of Ceres. Currently there are 
		about 1,300 known.
	</p></dd>
	<dt>Evhisae bodies</dt>
	<dd><p>
		These are bodies that are slightly more regular. They all orbit within Ambispai's orbit,
		and have inclinations between −5° and 5° (measured from the solar equator). They have 
		some manner of resonance with Ambispai, and hence are quite unstable and can be ejected out
		of the Alternian system altoghether.
	</p></dd>
	<dt>Gergisue, the Lone Alternian Trojan</dt>
	<dd>
		<aside>
			<h3>Our own Trojan!</h3>
			<p>
				We have our very own trojan asteroid as well:
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_TK7">2010 TK<sub>7</sub></a>.
				It isn't just a gas giant thing!
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			Gergisue is an asteroid with a difference: it is an Alternian
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_(astronomy)">trojan</a>! This little lump
			of rock about one-tenth the size of Pluto does a little dance around the planet's 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point#L4_and_L5">L<sub>4</sub></a>
			point.
			It's not very exciting or useful, but it's certainly a thing that has warranted study.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Gransens' Trojans</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			Gransens also has its own posse of Trojans – about 1,400 of them, spread roughly evenly
			around the L<sub>4</sub> and L<sub>5</sub> point. Certain (about 20) Gransens Trojans
			also migrate in and out of those two Lagrangian points, forming horseshoe orbits. These
			are also unstable due to interactions with other trojans and may be expelled in the 
			future.
		</p>
		<p>
			Incidentally the fact that Gransens has Trojans means that Ambispai has relatively 
			few trojans of its own.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Gensiren asteroids</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			Gensiren asteroids are asteroids that orbit between Ambispai and Gransens. There aren't 
			many of them (around 150 currently) and they are also relatively small. That said, it
			is the closest to an "asteroid belt" that the Alternian System is going to get, and
			that's pretty much it.
		</p>
		<p>
			There aren't many Gensiren asteroids because they reside between two gas giants.
			Though they orbit between 17 ~ 23 AU away from Primasol, the probability that any
			given asteroid will have an oribital resonance between either of the two planets are
			likely.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Abreizo, the double-asteroid</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			Abreizo 1 and Abreizo 2 are both Gensiren asteroids, and they orbit each other. They are
			quite big as well – each in excess of 300 km in their longest side – so they are
			discovered early on.
		</p>
		<p>
			These two asteroids are unfortuantely unstable and are expected to collapse into one 
			in about 10 million years.

	</dd>

<p>
	The trans- and intra-Jarsmisp objects are far more populated than the cis-Jarsmisp planets,
	but they are almost all the same with each other and there isn't much to talk about them.
	As such, the groups are not given names, just category letters. One saving fact is that the 
	trans-Neptunian objects are labeled much the same way as the trans-Jarsmisp objects, so the
	analogues are inserted in brackets after the name. Do note that the groups don't perfectly line
	up due to to Jarsmisp's odd case of not being a gas giant.
	Here are some notable groups and specific objects:
</p>
<aside>
	<h3>Name conservation</h3>
	<p>
		Most of these minor planets were never named, just numbered. Here, the number is simply the
		order of discovery. Note that certain numbers do not exist because a number is assigned
		when a discovery is announced and numbers are not recycled when a discovery is retracted.
	</p>
</aside>
<dl>
	<dt>Group A ("intra-Jarsmisp" applies to some in this group)</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			Group A objects are objects that cross the orbit of Jarsmisp but <em>not</em> Gransens.
			These objects are relatively safe from being ejected or eaten up by the larger planets
			because of Jarsmisp's rather weak influence on them.  From largest to smallest, the
			largest Group A objects are numbered A91, A13, A15, A215, A217, A450, A483, A51 and 
			A592. The lowest-numbered Group A object is A3, but A3 has been discredited. The
			lowest-numbered confirmed Group A object is A9.
		</p>
		<p>
			Group A objects are sometimes called intra-Jarsmisp objects as well because there aren't
			many intra-Jarsmisp objects to begin with (Jarsmisp has no trojan asteroids, and only
			one lonely little unnamed asteroid doing horseshoes around it). Indeed, some group A
			bodies also have a 1:1 resonance with Jarsmisp. Whether these 1:1 bodies are in 
			intra-Jarsmisp bodies, group A bodies or group C bodies are of much debate, and guess
			what happens when a debate happens…
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>
		Group B (analogous to "classical" TNOs or
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Kuiper_belt_object">cubewanos</a>)
	</dt>
	<aside>
		<h3>Reference failure</h3>
		<p>
			Unfortunately for anyone who cares, B612 does not exist. Trans-Jarsmisp object number
			612 is an D group object.
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		Group B objects are objects that do not have a resonance with Jarsmisp or Gransens and orbit
		in very regular intervals. They are fairly loosely packed together and a vast bulk of them
		orbit around 30 to 40 AU from Primasol.
	</p>
	<p>
		These planetoids vary a little bit in shape and size, more so than the Group C objects.
		Noted for being big Group B objects are B1, B45, B94, B220, B439 and B894.
	</p>
	<dt>
		Group C (analogous to
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_trans-Neptunian_object">Resonant KBOs</a>)
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			These objects are similar to Resonant KBOs, and basically they are any bodies
			that are under a resonance with either Jarsmisp or Gransens. (Again, the duality is
			due to Jarsmisp's non-gas-giant status.) This group is very unstable mainly because
			there are two planets that are attempting to pull them off the resonance status.
			The largest C Group objects are C58, C61, C11, C208, C480 and C1340. Especially of note
			is the strange body C1815, which alternates between a 3:5 with Gransens and a 13:14 
			with Jarsmisp. The lowest-numbered confirmed Group C object is C6, which is also the 
			lowest-numbered Group C object full stop.
		</p><!-- C418 is an existent object! Unfortunately, C4 isn't. -->
	</dd>
	<dt>Group D (Scattered Disc and Oort Cloud objects)</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			One major difference between the Solar System and the Alternian System is that 
			there isn't really much scattering happening – unlike the Solar System, the planets
			never really swapped places in the early turbulent days and therefore there is only
			a Kuiper Belt-esque item after the end of the last planet. As such there is therefore
			no difference between a "Scattered Disc" and an "Oort Cloud" object, and hence the 
			Troll method to group them under the same head.
		</p>
		<p>
			The biggest class D objects are D814, D1024, D1310, D916, D1515, and D1641. The most
			distant Group D object ever confirmed is D2004, which has a perhelion of over 120 AU.
			The lowest-numbered Group D object that has been confirmed is D230, and the lowest
			discredited one D199.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Comets – Group E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>3</sub></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			Comets are divided by their orbital periods: E<sub>1</sub> comets have orbital periods
			less than 100 <span class="altYr">years</span>, E<sub>2</sub> comets have orbital
			periods more than a 100 <span class="altYr">years</span> but will eventually return,
			and E<sub>3</sub> comets have no period at all – their orbital eccentricities are 
			greater than or equal to 1, meaning that they will be sprung out of the Alternian
			system completely.
		</p>
		<p>
			Comets are not numbered like the rest. They have their own number system, which is
			identical in nature with those of the other groups: a number is assigned when an 
			announcement is made, but not recycled when it is discredited or retracted. As such
			big gaping holes in the numbering exist.
		</p>
		<p>
			The oldest known comets do have names: Evenha's Comet, Gortasi, Privenayol. But the
			newer ones don't, and are always indicated by their class, a hyphen, then a serial
			number: 1-138, 2-481, 3-489. On occasion an object from Group A, B, C or D will end
			up migrating here, which will end in them getting a new number: for example, D2305
