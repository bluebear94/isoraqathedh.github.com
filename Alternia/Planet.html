	Alternia is a very large planet – at least, it is large in its system. It is the second-largest
	terrestrial planet in the Alternian system, and it is much larger than its brethren close to it.
	However, it is still quite a miniature planet compared to the planets its inhabitants conquer
	– it may be slightly larger in radius than ours is, but it only contains a smidge more than
	seven-eights of our planet's mass and orbit nearly twice as far away.
</p>
<p>
	Alternia has two moons, one stained with some malachite due to a <em>freak accident</em>, giving
	it a green tint, and the other with a bit of artificial pink dye, due to some
	<em>unrelated equally-unexpected incident</em>. These two
	mishaps has bestowed upon the moons some rather… interesting colors, which are visible from
	Alternia but is often vastly exaggerated in fictional depictions for rather irrelevant reasons.

	<figcaption>The three moons of Alternia and their properties in various units.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	As you may have inferred, Alternia has three natural satellites named Orveo, Yudo and Tempai.
	All of the moons orbit closer to Alternia than our Moon does to Earth. They are comparable to
	our own Moon, and in addition they are oddly coloured due to the 
	above-mentioned mishaps. They also orbit much faster than our moons due to their smaller
	orbits. One of the moons, however, orbit another one, making it one of the very rare "4th order
	satellite" (stars around galaxy, planet around star, moon around planet, submoon around moon).
	Yudo, the submoon, is so unusual that English fails to give it a good name, hence "submoon".
</p>
<h2 id="SatellitesGeneral">General information</h2>
<p>
	The origins of the two moons of Alternia are quite clear. Apart from their coloration, their
	composition are reasonably similar to the nearby asteroids in the cis-Ambispai region as 
	well as the "dead planets", which
	gives credence to the theory of coformation – that Orveo and Tempai formed out of the same
	proto-stellar nebular dust that also formed the other planets.
</p>
<p>
	This means their inner makeup is actually much the same: a heavy core of iron and nickel
	– long since solidified – with an upper, coolish mantle of hot rock rich in silicon, and 
	finally a carbon-and-oxygen-rich crust right at the top. Mantle circulation happens (slowly) in
	Tempai's mantle; it does not happen in Orveo's.
</p>
<p>
	Both moons have similar water content as well: some polar ice and ice at the bottom of deep
	craters where the sun can't shine on them and crack it open via radiation. Otherwise, water is 
	scanty and hard to come by on either moon, and in any case even the ice is covered by the 
	dye, making them hard to see.
</p>
<p>
	Notice also the orbital periods of the two moons form a 4:7 resonance. This is a stabilizing 
	resonance, meaning that it reinforces itself and ensures that neither moon will end up ejecting
	the other either into interplanetary space or into Alternia. The resonance isn't quite perfect
	– at any one time either moon may drift slowly out of a perfect 4:7 – but the stabilization
	process will ensure that it would come back again.
</p>
<p>
	Why are the moons colored so oddly? Well, in the introductory paragraph it was stated that it
	was due to a <em>freak accident</em>. What's the "freak accident"? The event is well-known,
	well-documented and it is certainly not a big secret or an embarrassment to the Trolls. Oh no!
	It's big, everyone knows it, and in fact it went on for so long that it will bloat this page
	to keep talking about it. So for more information about the Mistake to Dye For, you should go
	<a href="DyeMishap.html">here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="Orveo">Orveo</h2>
<aside>
	<h3>Expensive stuff!</h3>
	<p>
		If you were to scrape every last scrap of dye off of Orveo, you can sell it back on
		Earth for US$24 quadrillion! &ndash; except you cannot, because there is literally 
		<em>not enough money on Earth</em> to sell!
		<!--
			Vsauce tells us that at the present age, there are approximately US$75 trillion (M2 
			value).
		-->
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Orveo is the smaller one, and the one closer to Alternia. It has a mass of less than a 
	fiftieth of that of Alternia's and comparable to that of our own Moon (herein called Luna) and
	is also around four-fifths the size of Luna. It's made of slightly denser rock, but it's not 
	significant compared to the rest of the System.
</p>
<p>
	Orbiting closer in than its companion, its orbit is completely tidelocked, making only one
	side visible from Alternia. However, it still has some kind of "wobble", which means that 
	small slivers of the other side is also visible from Alternia (the same phenomenon can be 
	observed with our own Moon from Earth – somewhere near 60% of the Moon's surface can be seen
	from Earth). This "wobble" is less pronounced for Orveo however, and overall around 55% of 
	Orveo's surface is visible from Alternia.

<figcaption>Atom counts in 1 cm³ of the <br/> atomsphere of Orveo and the Moon</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	As seen above, the moon has a thin (about half a centimetre on average) dusting of quinacridone,
	which approximates royal pink. This light dusting, while easily removed, is continually 
	replenished due to whatever strange mandate the government may have enacted since the
	not-so-mysterious "accident" (see below) that began the dyeing in the first place. It doesn't 
	contribute much to the mass of the moon, but it does make the surface seem pinkinsh from 
	close-enough distances (usually, Alternia's too far away to have the pink show – you can see
	it sometimes, but not enough. Well, <em>you</em> can't see it; Trolls can see it perfectly 
	well.)
</p>
<p>
	What's it like to live there? The thin layer of pink dye usually carries into its very, very
	tiny atmosphere. Unlike Tempai, Orveo doesn't have an atmosphere generator for it, so it
	only has the joke of an atmosphere that our Moon has, except in this case it's 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_the_Moon">
		even more of a joke than our Moon's.
	</a>
	This is of course because Orveo's smaller mass, and also its proximity to Alternia, making
	it hard to maintain an atmosphere even if tons of gas is pumped in. This "atmosphere" pushes 
	on the moon with a pressure of about 7.7 pPa (for comparison, see Fig. 1.2c).
</p>
<figure class="minor">
	<blockquote>
		To compare the atmospheric pressure of Orveo to that of the Earth is to compare the
		capacity of a bottle of wine to the capacity of all of Lake Superior.
	</blockquote>
	<figcaption>
		Orveo's atmosphere and the Earth's, in perspective.
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Standing on the surface of Orveo, with appropriate breathing and survival apparatus, you will
	see a black sky with a pink ground. You can jump taller than you can on Earth even with your
	heavy suit weighing you down. When you do, a big puff of pink billows out from you, some 
	escaping into orbit (and eventually replaced with a semi-automated pink dye replenishment
	system, at least until before the present day) and the rest falling back down onto the surface.
	Everything – <em>everything</em> – is covered by a thin layer of dust. This thin layer goes 
	up and down large craters and fills smaller ones.
</p>
<h2 id="Yudo">Yudo</h2>
<figure class="minor" style="float:left;">
	<img src="img/Yudo.png"/>
	<figcaption>Contrary to popular belief, Yudo (left) actually exists.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Yudo is the runt of the litter; it always gets ignored when listing the moons of Alternia (which
	is quite an achievement considering that <em>there are only three items on that list</em>.) Why?
	Because Yudo does not orbit Alternia directly; it orbits Orveo instead. As noted above, this
	means that it is in a 4th order orbit around the galaxy, which is very rare due to the orbital
	dynamics in such a high-order orbit. (On Earth, the only things that have a fourth-order orbit
	are man-made satellites that orbit natural satellites of other planets to examine
	the moon.)
</p>
<p>
	Indeed, Yudo is very much a miniature version of the moon it orbits, complete with the strange
	coloring and the works. Of course, it's much smaller &ndash; it is only about one-twelfth the 
	size of Orveo, and with that it is barely <sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>2000</sub><sup>th</sup> the
	mass. Despite its small size, it is mostly spherical; if it were not, parts of it would be 
	torn off due to tidal effects (Yudo's still about three times larger than Phobos in terms of
	radius!) High-altitude items are also likely to escape Yudo's gravitatonal pull and end up 
	orbiting or crashing into Orveo, so the overall variation in altitude is also quite low.
</p>
<p>
	Yudo is, in many respects, a lot more like an artificial satellite than it is a natural one; 
	it orbits so low in its circuit around Orveo that it manages to clear a full orbit in just one
	and a half hours (as seen in the figure above); this is comparable to the International Space
	Station back here that orbits the Earth in about the same time period. It also screams around
	Orveo at an astonishingly low altitude – any higher and it will orbit Alternia directly by 
	escaping Orveo's gravity. Orbiting moons is much tricker after all, as you get much less wiggle
	room to work with!
</p>
<p>
	If one looks up from Orveo and Yudo is up in the sky, you will not miss it; its 281 km orbit 
	means that it spans a full 774°² of the sky! (As a comparison, the angle of the sky the Sun
	occupies to Earth is approximately 0.19°²). It's made up of pretty sturdy material however,
	so while tidal forces do contribute to huge stress levels, they do not rip the moonlet up 
	entirely. The constant stress does heat it up slightly, but because it is small enough the 
	heat manages to disperse completely rather than get cooped up in the middle and shot out as 
	magma. This leads to a fairly warm moon of 300 K, warm like a summer's day but not too much so.
	(In any case, a space suit is recommended as there's still no atmosphere to translate the 
	warm ground to the surroundings.)
</p>
<p>
	Looking back from Yudo, one would see a bizarre array of celestial bodies all moving in neurotic
	and somewhat disorientating manners. Orveo would hang motionless in the sky, whereas Alternia 
	and other planets do a dance full of loops resembling the filament in a light bulb.
</p>
<p>
	Its future is not particularly bright; while its orbit is stable, perturbations occur just too
	often for it to stay the course for too long. it is very likely that it would not last another
	million years, and will end up crashing into Orveo, or being ejected to orbit Primasol directly.
</p>
<h2 id="Tempai">Tempai</h2>
<p>
	Tempai (demonym: <dfn>Tempais</dfn>) is much heavier than our moon and just as
	much larger – to be more specific, the entire moon is four times
	the mass of Luna and 35% larger. Its size, together with some Troll influences on the
	land, can actually allow life to not just be tenable but actually flourish all the way up 
	to and beyond the present day.
</p>
<figure class="minor">
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Malachite-153552.jpg">
		<img src="img/Malachite-153552.jpg"/>
	</a>
	<figcaption>A sample of malachite. Tempais malachite is very similar to this type.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Like its smaller, pinker sister satellite, Tempai has also had a similar <em>incident</em>
	that causes it to be permanently colourized in a dark green. The pigment this time is finely
	ground malachite, which approximates jade green, the <em>other</em> rare pigment in Alternia.
	this makes the moon glow green – a dark green, not the neon green usually depicted.
</p>
<p>
	Tempai has gotten a lot more attention from the Trolls than its diminutive counterpart, being
	larger and in general easier to work with. While operations in Orveo never expanded
	much beyond pink dye production, observatory and vacuum laboratory, Tempai actually became 
	a large and viable community in and of itself, able to host large amounts of imported life 
	from Alternia and continuing to flourish to the present day.
</p>
<p>
	The atmosphere that Tempai sports is much more substantial than Orveo's, but it hasn't
	always been. Its atmosphere was a lot Orveo's, a thin haze of ions that eventually
	got pushed out into interplanetary space via the solar wind, but it's not as bad as Orveo!
	Because Tempai was and still is not tidelocked, minor tidal events caused equally minor 
	outgassing events, increasing its atmospheric content up a couple dozen times and filling it
	with lots of carbon dioxide (which gets broken down into oxygen and carbon via interaction
	with radiation from Primasol) and yet more hydrogen. This bumped the atmospheric pressure
	up to almost a nanopascal – a full 100 times more than Orveo's atmosphere can provide!
	(It's still pitifully small however.)
</p>
<p>
	All that changed when Trolls appeared on the scene – about −7000 PD. They came about, set up 
	shop like nobody's business, and started to grow on the planet. But soon they realized that
	they need some kind of permanent air supply to breathe properly and domes aren't going to cut
	it, so they started just turned waste into breathable air and that's pretty much how it went
	down. The result is that the "atmosphere" is severely bolstered by a couple of orders of 
	magnitude, all the way up to about 3 atm – corresponding to an increase of 10<sup>15</sup> or
	<strong>one quadrillion</strong> times. For comparison, that's a ratio increase matched by
	making a mosquito (about 2 µg in mass) weigh as much as the Great Pyramid at Giza
	(about 6 Tg or six million tons). It's an <em>achievement</em>.
</p>
<p>
	As was said before, Tempai is not tidelocked. There may only be a smidge more time in a
	Tempais day than a Tempais year (month?) but the difference is non-negligible, spinning about
	1% faster than it orbits consistently and meaning that calenders will notice it before too
	long has passed. This off-sychness is still only temporary, and eventually Tempai will
	end up being tidelocked, perhaps only in a very short order.
</p>
<p>
	So, with that in mind, how's the average view in Orveo in the present day?
</p>
<p>
	The sky is blue-green from the malachite dust and from the thick atmosphere, the ground is
	also heavily stained in green from the powder, although to a much smaller extent than 
	Orveo due to the existence of weather effects in Tempai. Like its smaller counterpart, the 
	dye covers most of the surface of the moon to a thickness of 0.5 cm, although there are thick
	and thin parts. Above, Alternia looms in the sky, with a lot of bright light reflecting
	off of its white clouds. Much dimmer but sometimes visible at night is Orveo, which is a pink
	dot that sometimes appears, and sometimes doesn't.
</p>
<p>Tempai was thriving. And it will also be, in the future.</p>
<h2 id="OtherItems">Other Items in the Environs</h2>
<aside>
	<h3>Number Zone</h3>
	<p>0.05000 AU = 19.43 Earth–Moon distances = 26.28 Alternia–Tempai distances = 7.480 Gm.</p>
</aside>
<p>
	The Alternian Environs are nothing if not full. There are many things lurking in that 0.05 AU 
	space, both natural and artificial, that are of note. We shall take a cursory glance of these 
	things in this section.
</p>
<p>
	In this section, the Alternian Environs are defined by a 0.05000 AU sphere that is centred on 
	the centre of Alternia. The Environs orbit Primasol in the same way that Alternia does.
</p>
<h3 id="Natural">Natural Objects</h3>
<p>
	The two moons aside, there are very few permanent natural residents in the Environs. Most
	natural objects tend to be visitors, away from it for almost their whole lives, returning only
	once every 5 to 300 years or so. They're also very small and irregular – none of them have 
	the sufficient mass to pull themselves into a spheroid.
</p>
<p>
	Alternia has exactly one Trojan, Gergisue, as indicated earlier. This little lump of rock
	is one-tenth the size of Pluto, with dimensions 105 km × 117 km × 121 km. It traces a 
	tadpole orbit around L<sub>4</sub>, and stays within 20 degrees of the point. This places it
	outside the Environs but this particular item is notable enough to be mentioned
</p>
<p>
	Some other rocks can be considered
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-satellite">quasi-satellites</a>.
	Pensigons is one of them. A small asteroid with dimensions 6.0 km × 4.0 km × 9.5 km, it's a 
	fairly tiny asteroid that is generally not visible from Alternia's surface. It is Alternia's
	send-up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3753_Cruithne">3753 Curithne</a>, and the two
	share many similar characteristics, including their sizes. At its closest, it can come to 
	within 0.04145 AU of Alternia. That's not a whole lot, considering that's only 22
	Alternia–Tempai distances or so, but complex orbital mechanics ensure that it does not collide
	with Alternia provided that there are no additional disturbances, be it gravitational influence
	from other planets or reality-bending video games.

	Another there are a couple dozen near-Alternian asteroids too. Like our Terran counterparts, 
	these things are kind of dangerous, and needless to say they're the things that did the planet
	and its civilization in in the end (or at least at 0 PD).

<h3 id="Artificial">Artificial Objects</h3>
<p>
	As can be expected, there are various artificial satellites near the Alternian Environs, 
	especially since the Recent Date (i.e. −12000 PD). These range from "defenders" (things that
	zap out any infalling debris, such as old waste satellites and the smaller of the meteoroids),
	"comms" (for textual, visual, aural or visual-aural communications (obviously)), "spies" 
	(giant CCTVs in the sky, if you will), to "Power Collectors" (imagine a socket in space), 
	"living quarters", and classified things that are stupid because they are secret.
</p>
<p>
	As you can see, there is almost no difference between the Alternian space environment and ours.
	With the exception of the living quarters, which are giant so-called "communal hive stems"
	which have the following things in common:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>They have a single straight <dfn>main tube</dfn> of a single unified color;</li>
	<li>
		They have a variable number (from 5 to 200) <dfn>branch tubes</dfn> with the same color
		as the main tube; and
	</li>
	<li>
		Each branch tube has a variable number (again, from 5 to 200) <dfn>hives</dfn> (you know,
		areas of residence) studded into them.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	And with that, the environment of Alternia is established. Let us now dive to the planet itself
	and discuss its properties.

<p>
	Soppy descriptions written by overromanticising authors with a propaganda-like twist aside,
	Alternia is a fairly standard planet. It's a bit too small to be truly life-supporting (it 
	can make do, but only just barely), and it also hold surprisingly much air for its size, but
	otherwise it's pretty much standard: standard distance from the sun, standard water content,
	standard tectonic activity, all that.
</p>
<p>
	Below are some factoids about Alternia, broken into small sections for your easy perusal.
	(Layout seems familiar? Go to the <a href="Credits.html" class="unavail">acknowledgements</a>!)
</p>
<dl class="bigfatdatadump">
	<dt>Orbit</dt>
	<dd>
		Alternia's orbit, like all other planets', is an ellipse; the ellipse's semi-major axis is 
		1.7711 ± 0.00022 AU and its semi-minor axis 1.7708 ± 0.00019 AU, giving it an eccentricity
		of 0.01841. This orbit is very nearly circular; it is about twice Venus' and on par with
		Earth's	average. It varies slightly due to the orbit of the two moons, and it can go up as
		high as	0.05 or as low as 0.0027 over the course of the last
		100 000 <span class="altYr">years.</span>
	</dd>
	<dt>Total Annual Insolation</dt>
	<dd>
		Compared to Earth, which has 1367 W m<sup>−2</sup> of sunlight power beating down on its
		dayside on average, Alternia receives only about 50% the sunlight power that Earth has, or
		in hard numbers, 697 W m<sup>−2</sup>. This is still, however, 20% more than what Mars has.
		It may have a larger sun outputting more power, but that fact is more than compensated
		by its increased distance – almost twice as far away from Primasol as Earth is from the sun.
		However, this is again compensated by the increased year length of Alternia, meaning that
		year for <span class="altYr">year</span>, Alternia receives just a <em>little</em> bit more
		energy per square metre than Earth's – 4.77 × 10<sup>10</sup> J m<sup>−2</sup> compared to
		4.31 × 10<sup>10</sup> J m<sup>−2</sup>.
	</dd>
	<dt>Axial tilt</dt>
	<dd>
		Alternia has quite a respectable axial tilt – perhaps it's a little bit extreme as well:
		about 41° 5&prime;! This rather extreme tilt seems to be created by some collision event
		very early on in its life. Whatever the reason, this high tilt means that the Arctic and 
		Anatarctic circles can step all the way down to 49° latitude – together with a very thick
		and scattering atmosphere, this means that a day where the sky never gets dark enough to
		be called "night" can creep to the 40<sup>th</sup> parallel. Mapped to Earth, this is 
		equivalent to saying that most of Pennsylvania, northern Spain or Beijing can experience
		such a thing as a
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Night_festivals">white night</a>.
	</dd>
	<dt>UV or more energetic radiation</dt>
	<dd>
		More or less the same as Earth's, perhaps a little bit less; it's true that the larger
		sun produces more UV, but Alternia is also further away, and furthermore the thickish 
		atmosphere blocks even more of it out than Earth's will. It suffers from solar flares worse
		than Earth does however, because its magnetic field is fairly weak due to a smaller iron
		core.
	</dd>
	<dt>Year length</dt>
	<dd>
		Being the fourth planet from Primasol, after Abresham, Pelvicot and Pebahars,
		Alternia orbits Primasol every 2.17 years. The ratio of <span class="altYr">years</span>
		to years is very close to 6:13 but not exactly.
	</dd>
	<dt>Mass</dt>
	<dd>
		Alternia is very, very slightly lighter than Earth, by about 13%. This is partially because 
		of the lighter rock that it is built out of.
	</dd>
	<dt>Density</dt>
	<dd>
		The average density of Alternia is 4250 kg m<sup>−3</sup>, much less dense than Earth's 
		5500 but will still sink in a sufficiently large tub of water. Alternia has, as mentioned
		before, a small iron-nickel core, so most of its mass is around lighter materials such as
		oxygen and silicon.
	</dd>
	<dt>Diameter</dt>
	<dd>
		Alternia is just a teensy bit – 4% – bigger than the Earth in terms of diameter, making
		its radius 6 633 km. This makes each degree of longitude and latitude roughly 115 km in 
		size. In its present state, the difference between the polar diameter and the equatorial
		diameter is no more than 1.4%.
	</dd>
	<dt>Surface area</dt>
	<dd>
		Being slightly larger than Earth in radius, it is proportionately larger in area as well,
		having in total 55 million km² of area – around 8% to 10% more than Earth has, not much
		more.
	</dd>
	<dt>Gravity</dt>
	<dd>
		Surprisingly, Alternia's gravitational acceleration near the surface is almost exactly
		7.9 m s<sup>−2</sup> – there are three zeros following the nine before the next digit.
		This is about 81% of Earth's gravity, or 25.9 ft s<sup>−2</sup> if you're old-fashioned.
	</dd>
	<dt>Internal heat and volcanic potential</dt>
	<dd>
		It's spotty in places but it's there, and when it's there it's quite violent. There's plenty
		of volcanoes around to belch out plenty of gas.
	</dd>
	<dt>Day length</dt>
	<dd>
		Alternia spins around once every 18 hours, 19 minutes and 22.9 seconds. This is about 76% of
		an Earth day. This value is increasing every so slightly just like our Earth's day length
		is, but because Alternia has two moons and not one, the change is somewhat slower and 
		certainly more erratic. This rate, for Alternia around 0 PD, is about
		+0.084 ms <span class="altYr">day</span><sup>−1</sup> <span class="altYr">century</span><sup>−1</sup>.
	</dd>
	<!-- 
		I might revise this number because it's completely made up – there should be a formula to 
		at least approximate it.

	<dt>Water, land and sea</dt>
	<dd>
		<aside>
			<h3>Number Zone</h3>
			<p>
				The <abbr title="Average depth value">ADV</abbr> <var>d</var> is calculated by the
				formula 
				<var>d</var> = <sup><var>V</var></sup>&#x2044;<sub><var>A</var></sub>,
				where <var>V</var> is the total volume of water on a given planet and <var>A</var>
				is the 
				total area of the surface covered by water. This is not exactly the average depth
				of all seas and oceans of a given planet, because ocean basins are not perfect
				prisms.
			</p>
		</aside>
		With a total volume of 1.298 × 10<sup>9</sup> km³, Alternia has only 94% the 
		water on Earth. By surface area covered, Alternia has 189 million km² of land out of 
		a total 553 million km² – in other words, 34% of Alternia's surface is land, compared to the
		29% of Earth's! Alternia has very slightly shallower oceans than Earth, though the
		difference is generally negligible – the ADV of Alternia is 3.567 km, compared to Earth's
		~3.838 km.
	</dd>
	<dt>Tectonic activity and relief</dt>
	<dd>
		Alternia has a larger mantle, and with two whole moons <em>and</em> a larger sun, the tidal
		stress is certainly higher. This yields a large amount of vulcanism and other related
		tectonic activity on Alternia – much higher than on Earth. All this means that the 
		mountains are far more extreme on Earth. The highest peak on Alternia is about 9.0 km 
		above sea level, and is found in the newly-formed continent–continent collision near the
		45<sup>th</sup> parallel. The lowest point on Alternia is about 13.4 km from the sea 
		surface, and is found just off the coast of <span class="tempName">Land 3</span>.
	</dd>
	<dt>Atmosphere</dt>
	<dd>
		There's a lot more "junk" (things that aren't nitrogen and oxygen) in the Alternian
		air than in Earth's, but there isn't any very good reason why this is so. That doesn't stop
		people from putting forward ideas, of course: the generally accepted consensus is that
		this is because the Alternian universe is older and hence more metal-rich universe,
		because it has been observed older, smaller, cooler, redder stars tend to have
		planets with less junk.

			Atmospheric composition of Alternia's atomosphere at different times in its history:
			pre-industrial, cis-industrial, and post-industrial.
		</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</dd>
	<dt>Atmospheric pressure at sea level</dt>
	<dd>
		The atmospheric pressure on Alternia's surface is more than twice that of Earth's –
		2.4 times, to be more accurate! This density is so much that even when on Alternia's highest
		peak, Mt. <span class="tempName">Peak 1</span>, can still be lived on by humans, and quite
		well too – the pressure there is 90% Earth's, despite being about 9100 m up. This increased
		air pressure allows heavier animals to fly – in this case, "animals" usually mean "lusus".
	</dd>
	<dt>CO<sub>2</sub></dt>
	<dd>
		As you can see above, CO<sub>2</sub> pre-industrially is in the realm of 400 ~ 420 ppm,
		but as the atmospheric pressure is that high this is equivalent to having 0.096 ~ 0.1% of
		Earth's atmosphere being CO<sub>2</sub>! This is roughly
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phanerozoic_Carbon_Dioxide.png">Cretaceous</a>
		levels of carbon
		dioxide, and this indicates that Alternia is not, and has not been for a long time, in an
		ice age.
	</dd>
	<dt>Temperature</dt>
	<dd>
		The average global temperature of Alternia as of 0 RD is about 19°C, a lot higher than
		our current 14°C. Over the last 700 000 000 years, Alternia's global temperature ranged
		from 13°C to 27°C, with the minimum happening during the horrendous Mid-Thivu-sawc Ice
		Age of 228 Ma when average global temperatures were estimated to have plunged to about
		12.8°C, and the maximum happening much earlier, at the early Phioutbe heating phase
		644 Mya when the global average temperature hit 27.0°C.
	</dd>
	<dt>Sky color</dt>
	<dd>
		The sky is a deeper blue than that of Earth's, and there is relatively less red light and
		more blue/UV light.
	</dd>
	<dt>Cloud cover</dt>
	<dd>
		With more deserts than Earth has now, and also less surface water to evaporate off of,
		Alternia in general has fewer clouds than Earth.
	</dd>
	<dt>Polar caps</dt>
	<dd>
		Whatever polar caps this planet may have had had long since melted away, because the planet
		is so warm. There is very little snow and ice on Alternia, except up in mountains and 
		plateaus, where icefields are not uncommon. To Trolls, ice is far more of a concern than 
		it is to humans, because they just don't see <em>much</em> of it. They are however familiar
		with it, and iced drinks are available.
	</dd>
	<dt>Climate belts</dt>
	<dd>
		Alternia has three climate belts on each hemisphere like Earth does. On the equator, a hot,
		wet 
		<abbr title="Intertropical Convergence Zone">
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone">ITCZ</a></abbr>;
		on 30° lines, a warm, dry horse latitude; on 60° lines, a cool, wet cloudforest
		zone, and near the poles, cool and dry polar climates. That said, the polar latitudes are
		not as cold as our polar zones – the North Pole will feel almost Nordic to most people.
		This is partially due to the lack of ice caps, partially because of higher levels of
		CO<sub>2</sub>, but mostly because the thick atmosphere is such a great heat distributor
		that the Alternian poles get much more heat energy than ours do.
	</dd>
	<dt>Air loss over time</dt>
	<dd>
		Alternia loses a lot of air all the time – almost twice as much as the Earth loses. This
		isn't a bad thing though! As Primasol ages and grows, the thinning air will slowly reduce
		its heat-retaining properties, more-or-less compensating the increasing radiance and power
		that the older, brighter Primasol may create.
	</dd>
	<dt>Biomass</dt>
	<dd>
		Overall, there is a little less biomass compared to Earth. There are a lot of deserts in
		Alternia, which means that overall land biomass is anywhere from 
		<sup>2</sup>&#x2044;<sub>3</sub> to <sup>5</sup>&#x2044;<sub>7</sub><sup>th</sup>s that of 
		Earth's. The seas fare better, with about <sup>6</sup>&#x2044;<sub>5</sub><sup>th</sup>s
		the overall biomass compared to Earth's marine biomass (the dust from the deserts are 
		excellent fertilizers) but most of that is simple plankton – big coral reefs are quite rare
		except in shallows of the bays near Ecchiae and Sewb.
	</dd>
	<dt>Habitat diversity</dt>
	<dd>
		There isn't much of that in Alternia. The place is dominated by grasslands, deserts and
		other open biomes, but rainforests and cloudforests do exist, especially in the southern
		lands. The milder poles do mean that the tundra and taiga are smaller and patchier, mainly
		relegated to mountains. A new type of biome exists in Alternia that doesn't exist on Earth,
		though it's fairly restricted: in places where strong winds and high waves dash over
		small islands, unearthly plants, firm, virulent and slippery take root and take over that
		island. The Trolls do not like to be reminded of this, but they have <em>never</em> managed
		to clear out and dominate these islands for long.
	</dd>
	<dt>Biodiversity</dt>
	<dd>
		Things aren't looking too good in the biodiversity line. Yes, there are two Australia
		look-alikes in there – Quuag-dulle and
		Yiattew–Phriutch to be exact – but each land in and of itself are quite
		poor in biodiversity, because there's not much land in there to live in. To make it clear,
		there aren't as many niches in Alternia to exploit than on Earth.

<h1 id="VisitingPreparations">Preparations for Visiting</h1>
<p>
	In the following pages we are going to head straight to the planet and do some ground-level
	tours! We are going to see the many geological beauties in Alternia, and also visit some major
	cities and other locations of interest.
</p>
<p>
	However, before we do that, we must do some preparatory actions to ensure that we are able to 
	survive on the planet, or failing that, at least ensure that we can ward off powerful predators
	and of course the odd Troll who's having a bad day. Getting from place to place is not a problem
	here, because we have any power of movement at our disposal, but if you wish to know about 
	human acclimatization to Alternia that this is the most important part.
</p>
<p>
	The tours are set in −1 PD, which is just before the Vast Glub. This is mainly to ease 
	transportation arrangements and other things – too far back, and travelling is just a chore; 
	too far in the future, and there are very few interesting things to see. We shall see both 
	the Troll side and the wild side of Alternia, maintaining a good balance between the two. Some
	of the tours will include flashbacks or flashforwards, either in the body or out in a sidebar,
	showing how some features looked like in the pre-Troll past, or the post-Troll future.
</p>
<h2 id="BeforeVisit">Before Your Visit</h2>
<p>
	Any good tourist knows there are things to be done if you wish to visit a far-flung place,
	and fewer places can be further-flung than an alien planet where you can't even expect the
	<em>air</em> you breathe to be the same as the air you breathe back home. This isn't a cakewalk
	– there aren't going to be McDonald'ses (?) or Starbuckses (???) strewn around everywhere, 
	and the closest thing you're going to get to an Earth meal is a cup of cold beer (and even that
	has a weird taste, because it didn't come from malt). You'll be eating strange meat and stranger
	vegetables for weeks on end – better learn how to digest it…
</p>
<p>
	It's best if you research your route thoroughly. There are many dangers hidden in the planet;
	even with the reduced tree cover in most locations we visit, there are many fast-moving things
	that <em>will</em> want you for breakfast – not least because of the oxygen allows this, and
	this makes them move faster than cheetahs at times! Don't push your luck.
</p>
<p>
	It's not just natural things you must take care of. Even in the relative safety of Troll cities,
	there's still many a danger involved. You'll fit in much better if you put on horns and grey
	facepaint of course, and in such a short-tempered civilization it's best to keep yourself 
	discreet and well-hidden, only talking if you need to and trying your best to speak with a 
	standard dialect – better take some phonology or acting classes!
</p>
<p>
	Speaking of dialects, you obviously also need to know the language. You'd be pretty much set if
	you stick to simple sentence structures – just quick quips of "I want to go there", or 
	"Get me a leg of equoid with a side of squatbush", and you'll live. Going to the movies?
	Reading books? Watching plays? Doing anything that requires more advanced language than this?
	<em>Don't</em>, for reasons that we will elaborate on the next section. You can 
	<a href="language.html" class="unavail">go here</a> for some crash-course language lessons, 
	and also find out some of the finer points of the Alternian language too.
</p>
<p>
	That's not all! The hardest part of any tour is to drag your body along with it, and this trip
	is no exception. This trip will be <em>extremely</em> taxing on your body, in ways that you 
	may never have thought possible.
</p>
<p>
	Take your lungs for one. Alternia's atmosphere has far more oxygen per-volume than Earth (26%
	vs. 20%), and above that there's a lot more of the atmosphere, meaning that you're taking in
	almost twice as much oxygen per gulp of air you breathe when compared to Earth. This is 
	invignorating, but your blood will begin to thin out to respond to that extra surge of oxygen.
	You should do a lot of exercise, especially cardio, before the trip.
</p>
<p>
	Now you're ready to go! Or are you? Well… yes you are. But you're in for a lot of stuff during
	the trip too.
</p>
<h2 id="DuringVisit">During Your Visit</h2>
<p>
	First of all, you'll most likely make first contact in a city of some description. 
	<em>Please, for the love of all that's good, <strong>don't</strong> mess with the Trolls</em>.
	You don't have the strength, nor the stamina, nor the determination to defeat them, and even
	if you can you'll get yourself lots of unwanted attention, making you a moving target. 
	It bears repeating: <em>Don't</em> mess with the Trolls. Don't pet them, don't feed them,
	don't anything. Make minimal contact and ensure you don't offend everyone – you simply can't
	afford to.
</p>
<p>
	Out in the wild, stick near the <em>boundaries</em> of forests if you can, and stay upright
	and use your bipedal advantage to the maximal extent. Run to the forest if you spot a rapid 
	rustling rushing towards you; you see something that looks like a particularly vicious ape
	and you move out into the open. Ensure you are as close to a metal vehicle as possible at all 
	times. More often or not, you'll be doing wild tours at day though, and because trolls are 
	nocturnal you don't have to worry about hunters. Unless you encounter the Alternian equivalent
	of Amazons of course…
</p>
<p>
	Don't exercise too badly. You'll wear out your tissues in no time if you keep doing that.
	Not only that, the extra nitrogen that you'll breathe in may cause nitrogen narcosis if you 
	keep at it, and that's no good at all. Stay calm, stay down and don't make sudden movements.
	If you need to, you can jump higher than you can on Earth – reduced gravity, yee! – but don't 
	push it too far, and the difference may be small anyway.
</p>
<p>
	Check your watch regularly. The hands on the clock has only nine numbers to point to, and 
	nighttime can come and go faster than you think. In the urban daytime, and the rural 
	nighttime, things can get very hairy indeed. It's best if you can set up a clock back here that
	tracks both days and months as well as "hours" and "minutes" – we're moving a lot up and down
	latitudes, and midnight suns and polar nights occur in a far larger area on Alternia than on 
	Earth.
</p>
<aside>
	<h3>Assoids? What Kind of Name is That?</h3>
	<p>
		English lacks a name for Alternian animals! The best this guide can do is to find a Terran
		animal that's close in form, find its closest Latin equivalent, and say that it's only 
		a rough approximation by adding -oid to the end of the names. Things like "humanoid", or
		"ossoid", or "feloid".
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Mountains? Avoid mountains unless there's a road or an otherwise easy way up. You'll most
	likely be asking for problems if you try and climb the mountains with a pick and rope.
	However, before you leave Alternia, live in a mountain for a few weeks, either in a high town
	or alone in a campsite. Pick one high enough that you'll get more blood cells in your blood
	by the time you lived there for 3 days, but not so high that there are snowcaps on the peak
	– glacierbreath is a terrible thing to live under, as are constant avalanche risks. The snow
	is much less present on Alternia than it is on Earth, but it's still <em>there</em>, and it's 
	still a force to be reckoned with. While you're there, also attempt to hunt down assoids or 
	glamoids. Those animals are rich in iron, and you'll need plenty of that to rebuild your blood.
</p>
<p>
	There are far more creepy-crawlies on Alternia than on Earth! Not only that, you have 
	<em>no</em> immunity against local diseases. While those diseases may find the human body to be
	hostile places to live in, they might mutate fast enough to really get you, and that's no 
	guarantee anyway. Cover up well, and cook all food well – if you brought a thermometer of some
	description around, ensure that when cooking, the temperature of the food goes all the way up to
	the local boiling point, 127°C, 400 K or 260°F. (The increased atmospheric pressure on Alternia
	explains the boiling point difference.)
</p>
<p>
	When you finally get home, there's still a couple of excuses to not go back to work while your
	body recuperates from the places you've been, but the job is less than pleasant…
</p>
<h2 id="AfterVisit">After Your Visit</h2>
<p>
	After you packed your bags and go back to the spaceship, head straight to the doctor. You have
	no idea if you have picked up some horrible disease or not, and it's best to not spread an
	epidemic to Earth, now, is it? (Now come to think of it, you <em>may</em> have started an 
	epidemic back on Alternia. Eh, it won't matter; it would have been predestined anyway, and 
	you kind of <em>know</em> in advance that they would be wiped out in a
	<span class="altYr">year</span>.)
</p>
<p>
	After that, <em>sleep</em>. Your body needs some downtime to ensure that you are ready for the
	touchdown to Earth. Do some small cardio exercise while you're in the spaceship.
	After you touchdown and go home, <em>also</em> take a rest. You don't 
	necessarily need to sleep all day, but don't do anything drastic like go straight back to work
	or join a marathon. You'll have a legitimate excuse to spend a whole week on the Internet, 
	at the very least.
</p>
<p>
	Have a party or two. You'll need some company after the long hours of being alone with 
	strangers/Trolls/strangers that are Trolls. Explain to them, if necessary, that you aren't dead
	and they should stop fighting over your possessions.
</p>
<p>
	After a month or two of this kind of thing you can then go back to your regularly scheduled 
	life. That is, unless you want to go on another mad-hatter trip to another foreign planet…
