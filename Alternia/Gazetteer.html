	Alternia has so many names in it! That's not surprising – it <em>is</em> inhabited after all.
	Click on a link above to go to an alphabetic listing, or continue reading to look at the syntax
	and details of a gazetteer entry.
</p>
<h1>Sample</h1>
<p>
	The figure below shows the entry for the largest continent on Alternia,
	<a href="Gazetteer_AtoH.html#E">Ecchiae</a>:
</p>
<figure>
	<blockquote>
		<dl class="bigfatdatadump">
			<dt class="continent">Ecchiae</dt>
			<dd>
				<p class="quickInfo">
					<span class="coordinates">Coordinates: 0°, 30°N</span>
					<span class="etymology terrnym">"Asia"</span>
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					The largest continent in Alternia. A fat, squat continent, it's generally 
					split – geographically and culturally – into
					<a href="Gazetteer_ItoP.html#O">Oae</a> and
					<a href="Gazetteer_AtoH.html#B">Bakijivu</a> on the North and West,
					<a href="Gazetteer_QtoZ.html#S">Ssiounsdu</a> on the East, and
					<a href="Gazetteer_ItoP.html#K">Khrrup</a> on the South, along with the
					<a href="Gazetteer_ItoP.html#E">Great Ecchiae Desert</a> in the centre.
				</p>
			</dd>

	</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>
	The headword, "Ecchiae" is displayed on the left side of the entry. Common nouns and non-nouns
	that are part of the name, such as "Great" and "Desert" in "Great Ecchiae Desert", are written
	after it, so "Great Ecchiae Desert" is written as "Ecchiae, Great Desert". Major features,
	which are mountain ranges, continents and oceans, are written in
	<span class="sc">small caps</span>.
</p>
<p>
	Next come the coordinates. Only a single point is provided, even if a large location spans
	several. The selected coordinate is usually the one nearest to the centre, with larger lands
	getting rougher (less precise) coordinates. Ecchiae, above, is so large it only gets a
	30°-precision coordinate.
</p>
<p>
	Next come the etymology for the name. All names in Alternia are created in three ways: 
	Class A names, in green, marked <span class="etymology terrnym">"Asia"</span>, are really
	Terran toponyms run over by five 18-wheelers and then reconstituted into the Alternian syllable
	structure. Class B names, in red, marked <span class="etymology fannym">"Seasson"</span>, are 
	Homestuck fanwork names run over by five 18-wheelers and then reconstituted into the Alternian
	syllable structure. Finally, Class C names, in blue, marked 
	<span class="etymology rangennym">S</span>, are names that are born out of the forge of the
	<a href="namegen.html">random name generator</a>. In this case, S implies that the syllable is
	generated with simple consonant clusters, and F means that the syallable is generated with
	the structure's full capabilities.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, there's a small blurb about the location, along with relevant links to other locations
	and the appropriate location in the tour.
