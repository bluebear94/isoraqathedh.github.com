	The story of the Dyeing of the Moons is well known and everyone knows it (that is, anyone
	who is authorized to know about it knows it). It's a simple tale of disgruntlement that
	escalated into hilarity. Strangely enough, no two versions have the same names for
	each character in the story, save the Empress Regent on High (you know, the top dog lass
	– things were named differently then), which is always referred to by her moniker. Because
	of this, the prose has been written to avoid it, and where it cannot,
	they have simply been given numbers in this rendition, and they look
	<span class="dyeName">like this</span>.
</p>
<h1 id="Background">Background: The Art of Saucemaking</h1>
<p>
	The two moons of Alternia have long since been lived on and colonized – Orveo was colonized
	in −8544 PD, and Tempai not much later, in −8480 PD. The two moons were of course the familiar 
	silvery color that a majority of celestial bodies were at the time.
</p>
<p>
	Eventually whole societies are built on the two moons. First came the scientific research
	colonies. Then came the industries hungry for new unexploited land. Finally came regular people
	with day jobs and eventually lived permanently on the moons.
</p>
<p>
	One of the most important 
	industries however is the dye industry. It is known that Alternian dye is mainly created
	via the highly suspectly-named "grub sauce" – this is of course, to put it bluntly, powdered
	baby blood. Nope, nothing wrong with that. However, this creates a quantity inequality. Troll
	blood is not evenly distributed among the eleven "castes" – there are two cinch points where
	the quantity produced via "saucemaking" is in the order of
	mL <span class="altYr">year</span><sup>−1</sup>:

</figure>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Jade blood</strong> (Caste value Þ = +2), in the middle of the pack, is 
		notoriously difficult to find, having a population density of about 20 ~ 30 ppb (only
		rivaled by royal blood, seen below). Trolls with jade blood are oddballs anyway, and
		their extreme rarity makes their culling very rare. In any given
		<span class="altYr">year</span> the paintmaking industry can make up to 40 L of jade
		paint from blood.
	</li>
	<li>
		<aside>
			<h4>Three in Four Billion?</h4>
			<p>
				Suppose that there is a Troll spawned for each human that ever lived on Earth.
				This value, which is estimated at 
				<a href="http://tinyurl.com/NumHumanPop">107.6 billion</a>, will mean that out of
				all the Trolls that we have spawned,
				<em title="80.7, to be exact" class="info">fewer than 85</em> of them will have
				royal blood.
			</p>
		</aside>
		<strong>Royal blood</strong> (Caste value Þ = +8), at the very pinnacle of the so-called
		"hæmospectrum", is by its name royal, rare and reserved. Not only does it appear severely
		sparcely (with density of about 750 ppt – to make this clear this is 0.000 000 075 0% or
		three cases every four <em>billion</em> births) it's also one of <em>those</em> things that
		require extreme bureaucracy to handle – only when the reigning Empress/Emperor is absolutely
		certain to be in the pink of health will the royal-blooded grub be culled. This means that
		out of the approximately 11500 <span class="altYr">years</span> that the paintmaking 
		industry has existed, a grand total of <em>30 L</em> of pink dye has ever been created out
		of blood, yielding a production rate of
		2.609 mL <span class="altYr">year</span><sup>−1</sup>. No one can afford dyed royal blood
		like that – the <em>whole of Alternia</em> has to contend for on average enough of such
		paint to fill about four M&amp;M candies – and the Empress has made it so as well – selling
		any pink dye marked as paint derived from royal
		blood is prohibited under penalty of death/culling/whatever term you want to use for
		legislated life termination.
	</li>
	<li>
		<aside>
			<h4>Fate of the Olive-Bloods</h4>
			<p>
				A hidden caste level, the Olive Bloods (Þ = +<sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>2</sub>)
				has been eradicated some number of years prior to this whole mess, circa −11 000 PD.
			</p>
		</aside>
		There are other paint colors that are derived from Troll blood as well, like for instance
		bright red, olive and pure black, and some of these colors can almost as rare as jade blood
		(not royal blood however), but those are of secondary concern to our story. We can safely
		say that the production rate is in the region of
		ML <span class="altYr">year</span><sup>−1</sup>, fulfilling their niche market.
	</li>
</ul>
<aside>
	<h4>Paint sales report</h4>
	<p>
		Approximately 900 million tins of paint are sold for each common color in the hæmospectrum
		every <span class="altYr">year</span>. Each tin holds about 17 L of paint. This means that
		about 153 GL of paint in, say, teal blood is sold every <span class="altYr">year</span>,
		which works out to be about one-third of the total volume of water inside Sydney Harbour.	
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	All that paint deficit has to be released somehow – color is <em>important</em> in Troll
	society. So what does one do, when your primary source of color fails? Look for secondary 
	sources or make a synthetic version. Jade paint is solved by the former, the more
	expensive synthesis of royal paint by the latter. Jade paint is very wonderfully solved by
	mined materials like crystals and minerals, and the right mix of chemicals required to make
	royal blood-colored dye is finally constructed sometime −9000 PD, opening up the full standard
	hæmospectrum for all to draw with. All is well.
</p>
<p>
	There is, however, one tiny snag in the plan – overproduction. The creation of these once-rare
	dyes ranged in the realm of up to 1 TL <span class="altYr">year</span><sup>−1</sup>, 
	completely outstripping the most common colors up to seven times. This appears to be an 
	oversight by some poor old cog in the paintmaking machine with the name of 
	<span class="dyeName">1</span>, who accidentally tapped the "000" key once too often.
	He was subsequently culled. Nevertheless the overproduction
	went on for over 80 years before it was brought down to the gigas from the teras.
</p>
<p>
	All that extra paint had to go somewhere though. There's so much paint that the incinerators
	can't handle them without completely disabling their ability to burn anything else, and anyway
	you can't burn dye or paint. So it appears the only solution is to send it to the moon.
	<!-- 
		Just like pony problems, paint problems go away when you sequester them in/on natural
		satellites. It's a rule!
	-->
	Both of of them, in fact. The smaller Orveo gets the less-produced pink dye; the larger
	Tempai gets the more-produced jade dye. The dye then is managed by several hapless Trolls 
	that ensure that nothing bad happens to the pile of paint.
</p>
<p>
	The summers go and the winters come, and after three hundred or so years the collective
	artistic temperament of the Trolls have caused them to steer into using a lot of these dyes
	(whether this is a mind-control exercise or merely a coincidence can be a hotly-debated issue).
	in any case, the demand of this actually managed to almost deplete the pile, and the 
	now-burgenoning Command, Conquest &amp; Compile Company which is responsible for many of the 
	troop-commanding, planet-conquering and resource-compiling that happens in Troll military 
	records is sent to get malachite and materials to make quinacridone to match the demand,
	which has by then actually grown to be about 2 TL <span class="altYr">year</span><sup>−1</sup>
	due to the increasing population. (At this point common colors have also passed the teralitre
	mark.)
</p>
<p>
	All that incoming dyestuff is then stored on the two moons because there's already a large pile.
	The originally-easy jobs of simply maintaining the pile and occasionally extract some out of it
	has now become a nightmarish job of looking for impurities in the incoming dye, ensuring that
	no dangerous explosives come into the giant tank, and other similarly bureaucratic jobs. At
	least that gave plenty of employment for the poor things that live on the two moons.
</p>
<p>
	We then go on a few dozen years, as this has pretty much completely set up the stage for the 
	Incident to occur.

</figure>
<p>
	A crew of five was manning the malachite containment warehouse.
	It was a boring night, but not an eventless one – they had 356 input requests and 805 output
	requests to handle, which is pretty much par for the course here. They were headed by
	<span class="dyeName">2</span>. They were rounding up the last requests of the day.
</p>
<p>
	Far, far away several years ago, a Tributatry State paid its daily tax to the Alternian 
	Empire in the form of pure money, dye and explosives. As usual, the tax was placed into
	little boxes with lots of words yet none of them were identifying; they had strange esoteric
	carvings
	on the wood and/or metal to identify them. The markings were translated into the content of the
	boxes they were on via a database management system, as it always was. And like all good DBMS
	systems, they had a guy whose only existence is dedicated to punching numbers into it. And
	because he's only ever good at punching in numbers, the actual marking and data creation was
	done by a group of runner-guys. <span class="dyeName">3</span> was one of those people that day.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="dyeName">3</span> was unhappy. He was unhappy because he wasn't a Troll. More
	specifically, not being a Troll, he couldn't rise to the uppermost echelons of the society they
	constructed. He wanted to, and he wished to express that. Naturally, the best way to do that
	was to mess up their society.
</p>
<p>
	So that day, he marked the largest box of explosives that he can find (the explosives are 
	strange ones that can blow the contents out of the house while leaving the house more or
	less intact save from a giant hole on the top) and marked it as "malachite", and a harmless 
	box of malachite as the explosive – the name of the explosive appears to have gone missing in
	all versions of the story – as malachite. The error is propogated up and out, and eventually
	back to Tempai.
</p>
<aside>
	<h3>Bonus Question!</h3>
	<p>
		Given that the signal travels at <var>c</var> exactly, that the ship travels at
		0.995<var>c</var> in a straight line from the Tributary State to Alternia, and any
		additional information in this passage, estimate the distance between the
		Tributary State and Alternia, and the perceived travel time of the goods.
	</p>
	<p>Answers at the bottom of the page.</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Back in the Tributary State, <span class="dyeName">3</span> did some final alterations
	to the box of "malachite". The box now had some extra "features" that allow it to be detonated
	with some kind of electrical signal. All it needs is that signal. The following week, almost
	exactly 300 hours after the ship left the dock, the deathly signal was sent. 
</p>
<p>
	You can see where this is going already. The package is shipped from the tributary to 
	a docking station just outside Alternia not much later, and from there, it goes to through
	customs to the storage facility. The entire process lasts about fifteen hours and is otherwise
	uneventful if you can ignore the fact that a high explosive is placed in a location that has
	no blast preventation to whatever capacity.
</p>
<p>
	And stay there it did, until about 75 hours after the suspect package settled into the storage
	room. At that time, at exactly −7977.9135181 PD, it blew up spectacularily, with total energy
	output at about 300 tons of TNT. The explosive did pretty much exactly what it was expected to
	do: it blew out almost all the windows on the building, as well as the ceiling. There was enough
	force to take the top off, and spill the green stuff all over the moon on a 3 km radius.
</p>
<p>
	Could <span class="dyeName">2</span> hear it? Can he hear it not; he was blown clear out of his
	bed (or whatever equivalent Trolls have, what with the funny cocoon thing filled with green
	goop)! The team assembled with the usual efficiency and discipline, and came around to the 
	blast zone, stained green from the dyestuff. With only the dim reflected light from Alternia
	to illuminate the scene, the sight is eerie and quite surreal: a large but fairly dim light bulb
	hangs in the sky, lighting up a sea of green and grey that crunches when you walk on it (fairly
	painful as malachite is <em>sharp</em>!) Far above, the stars shine, untwinkling, complicating 
	the shadows just a little bit more. Planetshine from Vemapaid and the two gas giants add
	their own shadows, imperceptible to humans but visible to Trolls.
</p>
<p>
	Picturesque descriptions aside, this mess managed to stretch over 30&nbsp;km in radius around 
	the now-open-top dye storage facility. The green mess, weighing over a megaton (one million 
	tons or a billion kilograms, 10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;g) all in all,
	has actually created a sizeable dent in the moon. Though it is imperceptible to both Troll and
	Human, without this weight the ground is starting to rebound, meaning that the green dyestuff
	is growing larger all the time.
</p>
<p>
	The situation looks dire. The manager cannot possibly clean this up in time; the orders will
	come in, exploded storage facility or not. Sure enough, a new extraction order has come up. 
	<q>How inappropriate</q> was the quote that <span class="dyeName">2</span> had as he grumbled
	and retrieved the order form.
</p>
<p>It was from the royal house.</p>
<p>
	Knowing that this kind of thing only happened on average once a <span class="altYr">year</span>
	did not help with his feelings any one bit.
</p>
<h1 id="Aftermath">Aftermath</h1>
<aside>
	<h3>FTL</h3>
	<p>
		Faster-than-light travel was still in its more nascent stages at the time! It would not
		become industry-standard before 3000 <span class="altYr">years</span> pass after this
		incident!
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Needless to say the Empress was less than pleased about the whole development, though unlike 
	most other Empresses she was not to fly into a blind rage and call her cronies to immediately 
	terminate everyone involved on the spot. Instead, in a rarely-taken move, she did the "regular"
	route and started up an Incident Investigation Group and left it at that. Things went on as
	regularly as such a contingency would be, and in the end, the correct person was blamed and the
	correct armies were dispatched. Unfortunately, the person they wanted to find died four years 
	before they arrived due to natural causes &ndash; stupid speed-of-light limit! &ndash; so they
	left it at that.
</p>
<p>
	This fairly lax attitude was quite a surprising turn of events, though not unwelcomed,
	especially by the would-be victims of the once-thought-to-be-inevitable big culling spree.
	What will happen next after this is even more surprising.
</p>
<h2 id="ShortTerm">The Short Term: Rake of the Century</h2>
<p>
	First of all came the order to get more malachite and start making the mess bigger. This is
	of course on the order of the Empress herself, and because there's no contradicting the Empress
	her will was done, and eventually a sizeable chunk of the body came around to be tinted green.
</p>
<p>
	That wasn't all though. Almost as if highlighting that this is a highly unusual event, the 
	Empress continued and upscaled the amount of dye production, and stopped all reconstruction 
	efforts of the storage facility. The incresing amounts of dyestuff are simply dumped into the 
	moon, indiscriminately and almost <em>casually</em>, which is quite a change from when things 
	were all managed almost to a bureaucrat's wet dream.
</p>
<p>
	Things get more and more off-track as eventually even the up-until-now unaffected pink dye
	storage facility was ordered to be blown up in much the same manner as the stricken malachite
	bar. The command was met with much amusement from the people who actually acted out said 
	commands, but when the same Empress then went on to order the increased production of 
	quinacridone, the intentions, also accentuated by the command to systematically paint every
	exterior wall of all artificial structures in their respective colors, were made so clear that
	not even the best vacuum glass of
	Ts<!--.replace("Z")-->ep<!--.replace("")-->raki could match it. We're talking about 
	<var title="Refractive index">n</var> = 1.00000001 here, people!
</p>
<h2 id="LongTerm">The Long Term: Rake of the Eons</h2>
<p>
	In case you were not clued in by the copious amount of clues that have been laid out in the 
	foregoing paragraphs, what the Empress was planning awas essentially developing the two moons
	into truly enormous tourist traps. Of course there are auxiliary motives behind the move too,
	vague things like "demonstrate the national strength" and "turning a scandal into something that
	looks like it was planned all along", but those are pretty much all just boons that come with
	having two oddly-colored celestial bodies.
</p>
<p>
	In a way, it worked. Much money have flowed into the coffers of the Empress in such a way, with
	the return being around 350% <span class="altYr">year</span><sup>−1</sup> (i.e. for every, say,
	$1 that the Empress spends on blowing up storage tanks and whipping the miners some more
	each <span class="altYr">year</span>, $3.50 a <span class="altYr">year</span> comes back from
	the resulting tourist trap) and as such the Empire can afford to look generous by reducing the
	burdensome tax system. With that, the overall reputation of the Empire went up to
	previously-unseen heights, 
	and while Trolls never cared about this "reputation" thingy they know all too well that it's 
	a useful construct to their perhaps pointless end of dominating Everything, so they are not so
	foolish as to completely disregard it entirely.
</p>
<p>
	The whole project is not without its faults of course. These feats of extravagance were quietly
	derided by Parasites (basically, the inhabitants of the "nail planets" you learnt about in
	Section A), virtually safe from retribution because of their almost inexhaustable supply of 
	one or more of time, resources or tactics. This strange Dyeing of the Moons, no matter how 
	technologically amazing it might be, doesn't really project a good light on the Trolls, who
	now has to deal with calls of splurging and being told they can't run an Empire worth anything
	even if they can conquer a vast one (kind of like Alexander the Great actually). Clearly,
	you can't please them all.
</p>
<p>
	All in all, the whole story got a relatively happy ending – a rare occurence in Trolldom, at 
	least with our preconceptions of a "happy ending" – and most everyone managed to escape the 
	saga with their heads firmly attached to their bodies.

<p>
	One can imagine that the signal and the ship track straight lines in spacetime, starting from
	the Tributary State and ending in Alternia. After transforming the coordinates so that 
	Alternia at the time of the explosion is on (0, 0), two lines are formed by the signal and 
	the ship, OS and AL respectively. We shift AL left 75 hours to OL’, so now we have two lines
	passing through the origin.
