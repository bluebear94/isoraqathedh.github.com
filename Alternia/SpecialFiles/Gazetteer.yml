        A short – both in height and in length – mountain range that came from years long past
        and has weathered quite severely. Not as severely as the Appalachians, however! This
        dwarf mountain range still snags whatever little rain and wind that is left that the 
        {{Nekhttae}}s can't catch – leaving leeward lands 
        drier than ever! The montains themselves are okay though – endless fog and drizzle
        from weak winds from the south, making the whole thing feel a bit Welsh.

        a lot of tours include this city for ease of travel.

        A vast savanna going on forest to the north and east, Wrro is a large grass plain.
        There's much speculation that the Trolls started out here. The savanna stands on top
        of a plateau of the same name, which causes the Savanna to become dry and not as rainy
        as land of a similar latitude should be.
