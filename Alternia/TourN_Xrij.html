<p>
	After visiting the dynamic and varied landscape that Bivu, Yiwgg and Iekka gives us, it's time
	to see the simpler, slower hinterland that forms the core of the continent of Sewb. Generally
	the region as a whole is called Wrro, after its central plateau, with the north being called
	Saesson and the south being Xrij. 
</p>
<p>
	A large proportion of the central part of the continent – and indeed, almost all of the true
	central part of the continent – is covered by a massive plateau about 2000 m tall, which is the
	namesake of this territory. The Wrro Plateau is such a prominent feature of the land it almost
	seems comical – a large pimple at the centre of the continent, spewing forth its fair share of
	endemic features. The Plateau creates its own microcosm of climates, and modifies biomes and 
	weather far, far beyond it.
</p>
<p>
	This is the birthplace of Trolldom – the very first Trolls come from this deeply insular place,
	and the Trolls have a strange affinity with it – depending on locale, time or Empress, the 
	plateau and its surround areas swing from being revered to being reviled, and development of
	the whole part of central Sewb was in constant flux because of the varying amount of respect 
	given to the land.
</p>
<p>
	The Plateau conveniently divides all longitudinal travel along it into three paths: the North,
	or Saesson Path; the Central, or Wrro Path; and the South, or Xrij path. We will examine each 
	of these paths in turn, north to south.
</p>
<h1 id="NorthShore">The North Shore</h1>
<p>
	The North Path, or the Saesson Path, borders the Saesson Sea for which it is named. It is a 
	fairly fertile if somewhat eccentric place; its high flow of trade and other related inter-Troll
	activities keep it from being off the rocker, but it is well known for its almost impenetrable
	dialect. There are certain populations beyond Saesson that doubt that the Trolls that live here
	are even Trolls at all, but rather mere parodies of their own kind.
</p>
<p>
	That assertion isn't entirely without merit. The Trolls in these parts can be rather odd; 
	their body forms imitate but never entirely emulate those in other places near, far and even
	unrelated. That could be very much disturbing to those unaccustomed to Saesson's properties,
	especially their propensity to add "ne" (The) to placenames, as you will see below.
</p>
<h2 id="SaessonShore">Saesson Shore</h2>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
	Entering the Saesson Shore from the west, it is almost immediately clear that this place is
	almost entirely different to Phiabsia. The boundary is gradual, though generally the consensus
	is that the "weirdness" begins somewhere before Hiplatt, in the middle of the Necchos Mangroves.
</p>
<p>
	Here, the climate is pretty sticky and wet, and the people (or rather, Trolls) here are taller
	and often leaner and more agile &ndash; this is the beginning of the Saessonites' realm of 
	ownership. Here, the people call themselves Trols (<i>Turoul</i>), as opposed to Trolls in the
	rest of the planet, which call themselves Trolls (<i>Turol</i> &ndash; notice the short o).
</p>
<h3 id="Trenvu">Across the Trenvu Bay</h3>
<p>
	The oddness of the Saesson Territories begin in earnest before you reach the Trenvu Bay, a
	somewhat eccentrically-shaped bay that is much wider than it ever should be. It is so big 
	that usually it is divided into two, West Trenvu and East Trenvu. As a general political
	division however the whole thing is still regarded as one thing: Trenvu Province.
</p>
<aside>
	<h4>Coins and Bills</h4>
	<p>
		The currency of the Alternian Empire is the Ceagar (C), but there are two kinds: 
		microceagars (mmC) is for general population use and is generally used for things like food,
		clotbes and other mundane things, whereas the macroceagar (MC) is used for big scary things
		like battleships and huge gun shipments. 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;mmC = 1 MC.
		Each Ceagar is divided into 100 microceagats (mmCt) and the macroceagats (MCt) respectively.
		If the context is clear the "macro-" and "micro-" suffixes can be dropped.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	The same cannot be said about its ecosystem and its populace however, as West Trenvu, and its
	biggest town of Tawnitin (holding about one hundred and ninety thousand people in total) shows.
	A cursory glance at Tawnitin's stats make it look like a terrible place to live &ndash; the 
	population's average IQ is 89, the average citizen earns about 45 kmmC a day doing general 
	pre-military work (the average pay globally is about 120 kmmC), and in general there are about
	350 preventable deaths for every 1000 (the global average is about 130 &ndash; note that 
	the famed "culling" does not count as a preventable death).
</p>
<p>
	East Trenvu's port of choice, Hlepfon, is not much better, but certainly paints a much prettier
	picture: the median income here is 80 kmmC and there are several Permanent Resident job centres
	here (that is to say, those jobs that do not require leaving Alternia &ndash; note these are
	extremely rare outside of Saesson). Indeed, Hlepfon, unlike Tawnitin, actually won a couple of
	prizes for being the most productive city once, so clearly Hlepfon isn't entirely without worth
	according to the rest of the planet.
</p>
<p>
	But if you walk around either city, apart from the strange accents and the comical behaviour
	of the citizens and the weird parodic movements of just about everything, you'd find nothing
	wrong. There are no big crimes happening on the street from day to day, and if you ask anyone
	living nearby no one would say that where they live are terrible and they wish to leave, even 
	the ones that were born elsewhere and moved in later on. So what is happening?
</p>
<p>
	The short answer is that the people who govern Saesson hates the people who live in Saesson.
	The long answer is that the people who govern Saesson detests the people who wish to have 
	anything to do with Saesson, so they painted a particularly ugly picture of it to deter any 
	potential immigrants. The people in Saesson, aside from their general eccentricity, are no more
	nor any less evil or good than the people elsewhere in the world; it's just that the rules that
	were imposed on them and what counts as an offence is much stricter here.
</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, the wildlife suffers quite badly from the affairs of the Trol(l)(s) and their
	silly drama. Routinely, the local government will "accidentally" spill some salt over some 
	otherwise-fertile lands, reducing their ability to grow, and quite often they'd lax the 
	environmental standards required to work there so that the landscape is somewhat ruined by big
	polluting factories. The profits of those factories usually land somewhere else other than the 
	residents of the territory, naturally. All of this results in some of the worst biodegradation
	zones in the entire planet, with an estimated 7000 species going extinct per decade.
</p>
<!-- 
	It isn't much of a secret that the richest non-royal in Alternia is a governor of East Trenvu!
-->
<p>
	The situation generally is better in the middle of the Bay though. Qule, which sits near the 
	middle of Trenvu Bay, is by far the best place to live in all of the bay. Everything there's
	a nice white-and-green heaven with bright limestone houses and smooth marble floors and bleached
	cobblestone roads. Even the water here has tinges of the live green of megaplankton and brims
	with fish, which is more than can be said of the dead, grey water on both sides of the Bay!
</p>
<aside>
	<h4>On the Origin of the Trols</h4>
	<p>
		Some Trolls say that while the rest of Trolldom left Wrro in
		13400&nbsp;<span class="altYr">ka</span>, Troldom left it in the much later time of
		13150&nbsp;<span class="altYr">ka</span>, making them more "stunted" than regular Trolls.
		Trols generally agree in their late departure from Wrro, but obviously they argue that this
		gives them an advantage over the Trolls, in their ability to more accurately sense where 
		they are and what to do, and even become smarter than Trolls.
	</p>
</aside>
<p>
	Qule of course lives in the hinterland, which gets much better environmental points because the
	Trol/Troll fight is less prominent here. Unlike on Earth and in most of Alternia, here it's the
	far-out, undeveloped, rural areas that are generally more progressive and accepting &ndash; 
	Trols lack (or less strongly pronounces) the desire to have and to govern, making them generally
	gentler folk than the rest of the planet would have you believe.
</p>
<p>
	The world that the Trols inhabit in Trenvu is generally considered to be just odd, and normal
	Trolls were taught that though they were odd they generally can still mix with the rest of Troll
	society. This becomes less true when you go further into the Mansi Plains, a pleasant, somewhat
	overgrown plain which can never part with its humidity. The two-L Trolls, now fewer and farther
	between, get increasingly xenophobic as a strange coping mechanism. Eugh, what horrible people!
	Let's go afield where intelligent life is sparser.
</p>
<h3 id="Mansi">The Mansi Plains</h3>
<p>
	You'd imagine the Mansi Plains might be heavily industrialized and basically not a "plain"
	as in green-grass and flowers-of-all-the-colours-of-the-rainbow plain, but you'd, as a quaint
	and pleasant surprise, be wrong. Saved by its immense size, its veritable history, and its
	tactical uselessness, the Mansi Plains is as much of a plain as the Kansas prairie – though
	with a lot less brown and a lot more green.
</p>
<p>
	That's not to say that Trolldom had not made an incredible impact – twenty thousand 
	<span class="AltYr">years</span> ago, this place was moderately dense forest rather than a 
	(practically) treeless plain. With all-year-round rain and plenty rich soil, the place
	can sustain a lot more than it does now, after the Trolls have done their own terraforming 
	projects
