<h1 id="Title">Site map</h1>
<p>
	This is a comprehensive site map of all things in this website, to further help with navigation
	and other related items.
</p>
<h1>General webwork</h1>
<p>
	These are works that ultimately belong in a page of its own and not in any other website.
</p>
<h2>Ponies on Lyr: Letters from an Observer</h2>
<p>
	<a href="Ponylyr/">Ponies on Lyr: Letters from an Observer</a> (also known by its acronym
	POLLFAO, which is pronounced <span class="IPA">[polfɐ]</span>) is a fanfic that began
	approximately Mid-June 2011. It's partially a xenoshock fic that is set within another,
	previously unrelated place known as <a href="http://worlddreambank.org/L/LYR.HTM">Lyr</a>,
	and is also an experiment in using full HTML(5) to tell a story that is textual in nature – 
	filled with title texts, sidebars and footnotes, and of course the ubiquitous 
	<code class="HTML">&lt;-- HTML comments --></code>, it promotes a non-linear reading order.
</p>
<p>
	It partially needs JavaScript to fully embellish certain places, and on occasion, the speaker
	is also used.
</p>
<h2>Status Altering Subtances</h2>
<p>
	<a href="SASubstances/">Status Altering Substances</a> (abbreviated as SAS) is a more
	traditional and conservative pony fiction (yes I am aware that a lot of this kind of thing is
	made but it's fun to make and that's all that matters).
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, this particular pony fiction, 
	co-worked with <a href="http://somepony-british.tumblr.com/">someone else</a>, talks about the 
	adventures of the, ahem, "Manesix" (pardon the air/scare quotes) inerbriated under a 
	certain amount of chemical that we are proud to call "sopor". Yup, that one.
</p>
<h2>The Beginner's Guide to Alternia</h2>
<p>
	<a href="Alternia/">The (or A, as it sometimes is) Beginner's Guide to Alternia</a> is a very
	<em>unconventional</em> <i>Homestuck</i> fanfic. (Yes, I can do that!) Rather than being a 
	generic Sburb clone, it mainly deals with the planet of Alternia (which is pretty obvious
	given the title) and the merits of the planet itself, rather than any of its Trolls and other 
	sapiogenerated things.
</p>
<h1>Utilitettes</h1>
<p>
	Utilitettes is a catch-all word for webpages that offer to do one thing and one thing only,
	often something limited in scope or usage. Due to the interactive nature of these webpages 
	JavaScript is a must.
</p>
<h2>MSPA Online Random Ship Generator</h2>
<p>
	The <a href="MSPA-RSG/">MSPA-ORSG</a> is a random ship generator for the forumites that
	participate in forumite shipping. It basically generates them with very little of what to 
	do with them. The first and foremost webwork I have done, and is the one that kick-started 
	everything else.
</p>
<h2>LNIIS:HS/FT Generator</h2>
<p>
	In my ongoing quest to make every character in the MSPA universe indexable, I have stumbled 
	upon the fact that, under a technicality, <em>all</em> "fantrolls" – characters with gray skin
	and bright orange horns that are not made by a certain Mr. Hussie – are "canon", meaning that 
	they are included in this scheme. I have developed this little thing to keep track of all the 
	trolls that have done.
</p>
<p>
	The future of this particular utilitette is probably a database system for all the fantrolls.
	Find it <a href="Fantroll/">here</a>.
