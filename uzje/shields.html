<p>Navigation in the roads of Ùzje is made easier with road numbers and route shields. Beyond the mundane M, A and B numbers, there’s a whole host of other route numbers that assist drivers and other road users in different and complementary ways.</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>All road numbers in Ùzje come in the form of a one- or two-letter prefix, followed by one to five digits, optionally ending with a potentially-bracketed letter. With the exception of the Asian Highway prefix AH, all prefices are one letter long. As of yet there are no five-digit-long numbers in the whole of Ùzje, nor any suffices that are not bracketed, but any such sequences are reserved by the Department for Roads and Transport to be used upon their discretion.</p>
<p>Each letter has its own namespace: the A222 may not necessarily refer to the same road as the B222. In particular, the AH1 is not related to the M1. However, some specific regions might voluntarily ban number collisions; this is done in the case of M, A, B and C numbers in Boan Isle, which restricts them to numbers with 1, 2, 3 and 4 digits respectively.</p>
<p>Road designations are unique on the national level; there is only one M4, A40 and B400 in the entirety of the territory. However, this is not guaranteed for the city numbers that start with Q, V and D. Those are only guaranteed to be unique within the city.</p>
<p>In writing, ideally the number designation is to be separated from the letters on either side with a quarter-space. However this is not commonly done, not even on official road signage; instead the common practice is to not separate the numbers and the letters with any space, even if there are brackets around the suffix.</p>
