<p>Navigation in the roads of Ùzje is made easier with road numbers and route shields. Beyond the mundane M, A and B numbers, there’s a whole host of other route numbers that assist drivers and other road users in different and complementary ways.</p>
<p><span class="ah">AH1</span> <span class="m">M3</span> <span class="m">A21(M)</span> <span class="a">A10</span> <span class="a">M3(A)</span> <span class="b">B230</span> <span class="c">C2201</span> <span class="q">Q30</span> <span class="v">V60</span> <span class="d">D3</span> <span class="j">J45</span> <span class="x">X1</span></p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>All road numbers in Ùzje come in the form of a one- or two-letter prefix, followed by one to five digits, optionally ending with a potentially-bracketed letter. With the exception of the Asian Highway prefix AH, all prefices are one letter long. As of yet there are no five-digit-long numbers in the whole of Ùzje, nor any suffices that are not bracketed, but any such sequences are reserved by the Department for Roads and Transport to be used upon their discretion.</p>
<p>Each letter has its own namespace: the <span class="a">A222</span> may not necessarily refer to the same road as the <span class="b">B222</span>. In particular, the <span class="ah">AH1</span> is not related to the <span class="m">M1</span>. However, some specific regions might voluntarily ban number collisions; this is done in the case of M, A, B and C numbers in Boan Isle, which restricts them to numbers with 1, 2, 3 and 4 digits respectively.</p>
<p>Road designations are unique on the national level; there is only one <span class="m">M4</span>, <span class="a">A40</span> and <span class="b">B400</span> in the entirety of the territory. However, this is not guaranteed for the city numbers that start with Q, V and D. Those are only guaranteed to be unique within the city.</p>
<p>In writing, ideally the number designation is to be separated from the letters on either side with a quarter-space. However this is not commonly done, not even on official road signage; instead the common practice is to not separate the numbers and the letters with any space, even if there are brackets around the suffix.</p>

<h2 id="motorways-m-and-am">Motorways (M and A(M))</h2>

<p>Motorways were first built in 1950 as an testing ground for eventually building them in the UK, which at the time did not have much experience with motorways. As with most similar roads in the world, the road always has the following restrictions placed on it, unless otherwise modified:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Only motor vehicles are allowed.</li>
<li>The vehicle must be able to travel faster than 50 km/h. Furthermore, there is a minimum speed limit of 30 km/h which applies as long as one is able to do so safely.</li>
<li>No learner drivers carrying class A permits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike in the UK, where motorways are blue, Ùzje motorways are associated with the colour green. This is mainly to conform to the colour scheme of nearby countries, which also use green for their motorway-like roads.</p>
<p>Motorway numbers are assigned in a grid: odd numbers go north-south, even numbers go east-west. Small motorways, like the <span class="m">M30</span>, take their parent motorway’s number as the first digit, and some arbitrary digit placed on the units digit. Various circumstances prevent another major motorway from being built, and there is yet to be a situation where there isn’t an obvious parent motorway.</p>

</figure>
<p>Sometimes A roads can be upgraded into a motorway. if they are, then they are <em>full</em> motorways, and their name gains an (M) suffix. This particularly ugly designation was copied directly from the UK, which had since then decided on that format and just copied it wholesale for when similar things happened in Ùzje. As with other motorways, they have a green background.</p>
<h2 id="service-roads-ma">Service roads (M(A))</h2>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Where a new road was built specifically in a motorway, sometimes a bit of all-purpose road is placed next to the motorway in order to allow for some of the benefits of the new road to be given to non-motorway traffic and also to reduce the amount of junctions required for an urban motorway.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is not allowed for a road like the <span class="m">A21(M)</span> to have a service road called the A21(M)(A). That’d be far too silly; instead it retains the old number, which means that it is quite sensibly called the <span class="a">A21</span>.</p>
<h2 id="first-class-roads-a">First-class roads (A)</h2>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>A first class road is the major road that’s usable for everyone, including bicycles, pedestrians and (theoretically) equestrians. For this purpose they are also called “all-purpose roads”.</p>
<p>The quality of A roads vary greatly, from motorway-in-all-but-name to simply one lane in each direction in a single carriageway. In urban areas, they often have traffic lights control junctions, whereas outside of them they tend to have priority over other roads. They are associated with the colour blue.</p>
<p>A roads generally have two or three digits. There are, by law, no A roads with a single digit. Numbering of them are coördinated with B and C roads into zones, which are defined more-or-less arbitrarily and divide the entire territory into seven zones:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Namfuŋ / Näqveq, otherwise known as Boan Isle</li>
<li>Lokcəxn Peninsula</li>
<li>The Goŋ Hundred</li>
<li>The Backhill</li>
<li>Ajü Ajł and Zəjə</li>
<li>Wuqoj Isle</li>
<li>Zone 7</li>
</ol>
<p>Three of these zones (2, 3 and 4) divide the mainland to give lots of A road numbers to it, and the rest divides up all the island, with Boan Isle getting 1, Ajü and Zəxjü getting 5, the four island cluster of Wuqoj getting 6, and 7 mopping up everything else.</p>
<h2 id="second-class-roads-b">Second-class roads (B)</h2>
<figure>
<img src="img/B-road.png" alt="A shield for the B357" /><figcaption>A shield for the B357</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>B roads are secondary route to A roads, but they otherwise have the qualities of an A road. They normally aren’t as high-quality, however, and they don’t expect a large amount of traffic. It is expected that most drivers use this road to move around a district or as an alternative on rural roads.</p>
<h2 id="unclassified-roads-c">Unclassified roads (C)</h2>
<figure>
<img src="img/C-road.png" alt="A shield for the C2010" /><figcaption>A shield for the C2010</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>C roads are named “unclassified” roads because originally it was planned that these roads don’t have numbers at all, and so they are called “unclassified”. But later on, it was decided that every road needs a national number, so any road that doesn’t have one already are then assigned a 4-digit C road, which also follow the zoning that A roads follow.</p>
