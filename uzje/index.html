<p>In the year 1842, a sleepy fishing town in the south of China was captured by the British over something about drugs. A hundred and fifty years on, the town has grown to be the home of seven million inhabitants and so much money and political clout that it has become the world’s most country-like region that isn’t actually isn’t a country. On the 25th of March, 1990, the archipelago was declared to be a joint administration zone where it is simultaneously both part of its colonial parent and its geographical parent in perpetuity, an evolution which has been talked about since the late 1970s after various rebellions.</p>
<p>As a result, Ùzje is an interesting city-state, product of many thousands of years of Chinese neglect and several decades of intense British exploitation. Though it claims to be a place where east meets west, the claim is largely a PR statement with little in the way to back it up. For instance, although most official items are bilingual, including road signs, documents, officials and the Law Establishment House, the only <em>real</em> language that is spoken in these fair isles is Man Gog Yuu, a Chinese variety that some enterprising fellow not so far in the north has created as a rebellion to the fading Chinese empire in the turn of the 20th century. The region’s other language, g’Mòdyfäjq, is imposed by the colonials, and while it has become the prestige dialect of the region, it is largely ignored by the public.</p>
<p>Though the British may not have caught the public of Ùzje by their tongue, they certainly have caught them by their actions: drivers drive on the left, commuters stand on the right on escalators, and above all there are massive queues for everything and a hundred and one unwritten rules about it. Even some of the flora and fauna of the UK was imported in here in hopes of making the place homely, but not many of the imported species managed to last very long in the sweltering heat, which in retrospect was not the worst outcome for such an introduction. It definitely kept the region’s biodiversity largely untouched.</p>
<p>The colony was built to be a financial capital from the get go. Initially it was just to import narcotics to the empire to the north, but eventually it was a great staging ground to the rest of East Asia, and the city eventually grew its container and storage ports until it is largely unparallelled throughout the region. Eventually banks and factories moved in, exploiting the region’s great interconnectivity. But despite their almost criminal influence over the local government, and all their wishes that the currency of the region can move beyond the archaic systems of pounds, shillings and pence, Ùzje’s pound, the UJP, remains a non-decimal currency, although the financial sector have attempted to decimalise, and therefore some currency values are almost exclusively used by them.</p>
<p>For all its faults Ùzje remains an attractive tourist destination, whether it’s just for sightseeing or if it’s for establishment of slightly shady shell companies. Tourists love the food, the lights, and the excellent wilderness, whereas the low tax rates and strong connections make it a great spot for many businesses to set foot. The only ones that don’t really benefit very much from this affair are the long-standing and long-suffering inhabitants of these very isles, who have to put up with the whims of three kings and the demands of half a dozen more cultural expectations imported from all over the world. But hey, at least they get pretty good healthcare.</p>
<h1 id="essentials">Essentials</h1>
<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>Ùzje is, according to its Basic Law, a bilingual region. The two languages are <strong>Man Gog Yuu</strong> and <strong>g’Mòdyfäjq</strong>. However, the actual bilingualism of the place is somewhat questionable, as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Invented by enterprising idealist Jjan Yuu Manr some time in the late 1890s and published on 1901-05-06 in Canton, Man Gog Yuu is an auxiliary language that attempts to be the common language of all of East Asia, although it was originally built to be a language for use of the anti-imperial rebellion. Unlike certain similar movements in Europe, this one grew to be surprisingly successful, but the reach is still not as far as the creator would have hoped; it has become the administrative language of the South China region for sure, as well as strongholds in northern Vietnam and some parts of Taiwan and Ryukyu, but it spread was hampered in Korea and Japan and it’s actively being suppressed in the North.</p>
<p>As one can expect it is largely a few lexemes drawn from Japanese, Korean, a smattering of Chinese dialects and a smidgen of Vietnamese embedded in a largely Classical Chinese matrix. There are a handful of particles that act as case endings that are imported from Japanese, and the script is Hangul, the script invented in Korea, but Vietnamese involvement is minimal short of a few token lexemes and the fact that the Romanisation is bafflingly one syllable per space-separated word.</p>
<p>As with its source languages, the script is written in square blocks, with options to write horizontally and vertically. The script is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_mixed_script">Korean mixed script</a>, where Chinese characters are employed to write lexemes – content words – and grammatical particles and conjunctions are written in Hangul. There is quite a lot of variation and leeway as to which word is written as which script, but it was advised in the source book that Chinese characters are to be used as far as possible to increase interoperability across the region.</p>
<p>The Latin script is also adopted as an official script, which was intended to replace the characters after Westernisation but such a thing never happened and now the Latin script is merely a conventional way to translate names into langauges using Latin-based scripts. Yuu Manr has ignored some of the subtleties of the Latin characters in favour of convenience in transliteration, as a manner of attempting to establish an East Asian identity separate from the West while still enabling exchange with them.</p>

<p>A particularly unusual drawl in some unspecified location in the British Isles have brought forth this highly aberrant language, which while clearly descended from English has been altered so extensively that there are no doubts that it is a completely separate language. There are some speculations that the radical and at times implausible changes are a product of conscious change rather than unconscious wandering, but such claims have never been supported with evidence, short of a few sporadic word derivation systems here and there.</p>
<p>The language has a special relationship with English, which exists elsewhere in the remnants of the British Empire. There is a one-way system for translating English words into g’Mòdyfäjq, which is called c’preq. The “translation”’s goal is not to import the word into g’Mòdyfäjq, but to make an alternate version of the word that has features and qualities unique to g’Mòdyfäjq. This system grew out of an in-joke of sorts that has spread to become part of the standard language and there is sufficient evidence in the way of written records to confirm that this feature at least is a deliberate and conscious addition to the language. The alternate orthography, which is in Cyrillic, provides further obfuscation and is another invention.</p>
<p>g’Mòdyfäjq has been selected as the colonial language of the region rather than English proper because Ùzje has never really been a normal colony. First of all, there are several interesting characters that were appointed as governors of the region – specifically, those who are privy to the business regarding g’Mòdyfäjq and are sympathetic to it for various reasons, not least of which is that one of them is a spearhead of the language itself. Another key fact is that Ùzje has always been somewhat rebellious and wishes to be independent in some way or another, and granting them a separate language is a very easy way to placate the colonials that have found their way there. Finally the fact that Ùzje is such an established based for g’Mòdyfäjq speakers have ensured that the place will become attractive for more g’Mòdyfäjq speakers, making a feedback loop that all ends up with it being the official language over English.</p>
<p>However g’Mòdyfäjq has never been that popular outside of the aristocratic elite and therefore in the street apart from a few compulsory lessons and some rare cases the language is largely unspoken. There had been grumbles that English should be adopted over all, but those proposals have never made it into the polls, for whatever reason. There are also government-subsidised courses that teach translating English to g’Mòdyfäjq but those rarely get attendence.</p>
<p>g’Mòdyfäjq has shown itself elsewhere the remainders of the Empire as well, with established speaking communities in Australia and New Zealand, as well as isolated pockets in New Columbia. Its usage outside of Anglosphere-dominated areas is virtually unheard-of, though a few significant exceptions exist in the Netherlands and parts of ex-Colonial Africa.</p>
<h3 id="other-languages">Other languages</h3>
<p>The source languages of g’Mòdyfäjq and Man Gog Yuu, which are English, and the varieties of Chinese and Japanese repsectively, still do have some presence in Ùzje but are significantly muted in favour of the two official languages. However place names in g’Mòdyfäjq are derived mostly from the corresponding Cantonese place names, rather than through their Man Gog Yuu pronunciations. This sometimes results in places where the g’Mòdyfäjq name can sometimes distinguish names while the Man Gog Yuu name cannot.</p>
<p>Apart from those, a smattering of other languages have significant minorities. On the Asian side we have immigrants (and/or invaders) from Japan and Korea that have came in through their Man Gog Yuu speaking credentials but have also brought their native languages along; the local market for domestic helpers have brought Indonesian and Tagalog, as well as the various languages in India; and there’s also a handful of Vietnamese speakers, enough for them to form a newspaper. On the European front, there’s German, Dutch, French and Spanish, in decreasing order of speaking population. Most of these speakers, Asian and European, also speak one of the two official languages, due to the government heavily promoting them.</p>
<h2 id="currency-and-pricing">Currency and Pricing</h2>
<p>The Ùzje Pound (£ or U£) is a non-decimal currency. It is based on the British currency of the same name, and is also divided the same way – twelve pence make a shilling, twenty of which make a pound. The penny is also divided into four farthings, but in general only halfpennies are used.</p>
<aside>
    SI multiples can also appear next to pounds,
    but only the multiplicative (> 1) ones and only informally.
    SI multiples may never be used on shillings.
</aside>
<p>In response to decimalisation, one thousand pennies also make a kilopenny (kd). One kilopenny is equal to two pounds, three shillings and fourpence. Although heavily used in the financial sector, the kilopenny has never found much use outside of it apart from some commemorative currency and as a price point. Further SI multiples may be used, resulting in Md, Gd, Td, and so on. Diminutive multiples are rare, except for the millipenny (md), which is the trading currency used in the Ùzje stock market.</p>
<p>The standard method of writing a currency in pounds-shillings-pence is to write separate the three units with slashes or short horizontal lines, and sandwich the entire expression in (U)£…(d), so for instance the kilopenny is written as £2/3/4d or U£2–3–4. However, there is significant variation in practise, and the format is also written £2 3s 4d, £2+3/4 or even 43′ 4″.</p>
<p>The kilopenny family of values have a slightly different way of notation. A number, which is either an integer or a decimal with a multiple of three decimal places is then followed by a space then the unit. One pound, which is equal to 240 d, is then either written as such, or as 0.240 kd, 0.000 240 Md, and so on and so forth. Note that 250 md is a farthing, but 250 Md is one billion farthings, which is equal to U£1 041 666/13/4, so while case distinction is significant there is <em>usually</em> enough context to distinguish the two.</p>

<p>Food is usually pretty affordable and reasonable here, as long as one either sticks to fast food and local cuisine. These are typically found in less touristy places (of course) and are family-run. The taste is generally agreeable to all, though for the more adventurous eaters there are exotic meals available near Zestəq Tel.</p>

<p>Transport is inexpensive and plentiful. The relatively small area of Ùzje combined with (mostly) agreeable terrain makes it very easy for a public transport system to flourish and grow. That having been said, the roads are plenty wide, and apart from the perpetual and inevitable problem of finding car space and the noticeably expensive petrol tax private cars are largely pleasurable to use in the territory. However, cyclists beware, as bike hiring is exorbitant and it might be better to buy or bring your own bike.</p>

<p>If you’re living here, the rent would be completely unreasonable, but if it’s just for a stay in the hotels then Ùzje lets up a little. As with most Asian countries, the lack of land suitable for city-building has led to many compact designs, including the budget “capsule hotel”, which is little more than a 275 × 150 cm bed and an enclosure.</p>
<p>Although prices are here given in pounds, it is a custom of the real estates agency to print prices in megapence with pounds being secondary. 1 Md = £4166/13/4, but usually to make things easier prices are in multiples of 3 Md = £12500 exactly.</p>
<h1 id="getting-in">Getting in</h1>

<p>By far the most popular way to get into Ùzje is through the gargantuan Þrulaqt-Pleqhevəq ə’Ùzje – Ùzje International Airport. The five-runway, three-terminal airport is placed on the edge of the territory, directly next to the western end of the M4 and accessed via the A550 to A555 roads. It handles aeroplane movement (takeoff or landing) once every twenty to thirty seconds, resulting in a yearly throughput of about 700,000 flights, or 24 MU.</p>
<p>Navigation throughout the airport is relatively simple if somewhat tiring due to its massive size. The signs are usually adequate, although there are a few trouble spots where a sign might be ambiguous or absent. The roads around the airport are a bit of a maze and require close attention to signage or a good GPS. The parking is a little bit inadequate for airports of its size, and there isn’t much of a car rental service either.</p>
<p>For such a large airport the landside (before security) area is curiously undersized, especially for the oldest terminal; this is because the government was expecting that tourists would go to nearby Szajmej to do their last- (or first-) minute shopping, confident that the prices in an urban and residential area would be much closer to the prices in the airport area and therefore spending more. The two places are literally on either side of the M4, and a dedicated shuttle service and driverless train service moves tourists between them.</p>
<p>Security is largely painless, or at least as painless as the international authroities can allow; immigration for locals are convenient and electronic but for those who <em>really</em> don’t want to hand over their fingerprints to the government a manual service is available. Past security there is a much more sizeable collection of shops – going back to Szajmej is no longer an option – and a couple of automated trains connecting the airside areas of the terminals together.</p>
