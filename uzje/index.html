<p>In the year 1842, a sleepy fishing town in the south of China was captured by the British over something about drugs. A hundred and fifty years on, the town has grown to be the home of seven million inhabitants and so much money and political clout that it has become the world’s most country-like region that isn’t actually isn’t a country. On the 25th of March, 1990, the archipelago was declared to be a joint administration zone where it is simultaneously both part of its colonial parent and its geographical parent in perpetuity, an evolution which has been talked about since the late 1970s after various rebellions.</p>
<p>As a result, Ùzje is an interesting city-state, product of many thousands of years of Chinese neglect and several decades of intense British exploitation. Though it claims to be a place where east meets west, the claim is largely a PR statement with little in the way to back it up. For instance, although most official items are bilingual, including road signs, documents, officials and the Law Establishment House, the only <em>real</em> language that is spoken in these fair isles is Man Gog Yuu, a Chinese variety that some enterprising fellow not so far in the north has created as a rebellion to the fading Chinese empire in the turn of the 20th century. The region’s other language, g’Mòdyfäjq, is imposed by the colonials, and while it has become the prestige dialect of the region, it is largely ignored by the public.</p>
<p>Though the British may not have caught the public of Ùzje by their tongue, they certainly have caught them by their actions: drivers drive on the left, commuters stand on the right on escalators, and above all there are massive queues for everything and a hundred and one unwritten rules about it. Even some of the flora and fauna of the UK was imported in here in hopes of making the place homely, but not many of the imported species managed to last very long in the sweltering heat, which in retrospect was not the worst outcome for such an introduction. It definitely kept the region’s biodiversity largely untouched.</p>
<p>The colony was built to be a financial capital from the get go. Initially it was just to import narcotics to the empire to the north, but eventually it was a great staging ground to the rest of East Asia, and the city eventually grew its container and storage ports until it is largely unparallelled throughout the region. Eventually banks and factories moved in, exploiting the region’s great interconnectivity. But despite their almost criminal influence over the local government, and all their wishes that the currency of the region can move beyond the archaic systems of pounds, shillings and pence, Ùzje’s pound, the UJP, remains a non-decimal currency, although the financial sector adopted SI prefixes for the UJP’s smallest unit, resulting in kilopence, megapence, gigapence, &amp;c. – currency values that are almost exclusively used by them.</p>
<p>For all its faults Ùzje remains an attractive tourist destination, whether it’s just for sightseeing or if it’s for establishment of slightly shady shell companies. Tourists love the food, the lights, and the excellent wilderness, whereas the low tax rates and strong connections make it a great spot for many businesses to set foot. The only ones that don’t really benefit very much from this affair are the long-standing and long-suffering inhabitants of these very isles, who have to put up with the whims of three kings and the demands of half a dozen more cultural expectations imported from all over the world. But hey, at least they get pretty good healthcare.</p>

<p>Ùzje is, according to its Basic Law, a bilingual region. The two languages are <strong>Man Gog Yuu</strong> and <strong>g’Mòdyfäjq</strong>. However, the actual bilingualism of the place is somewhat questionable, as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Invented by enterprising idealist Jjan Yuu Manr some time in the late 1890s and published on 1901-05-06 in Canton, Man Gog Yuu is an auxiliary language that attempts to be the common language of all of East Asia, although it was originally built to be a language for use of the anti-imperial rebellion. Unlike certain similar movements in Europe, this one grew to be surprisingly successful, but the reach is still not as far as the creator would have hoped; it has become the administrative language of the South China region for sure, as well as strongholds in northern Vietnam and some parts of Taiwan and Ryukyu, but it spread was hampered in Korea and Japan and it’s actively being suppressed in the North.</p>
<p>As one can expect it is largely a few lexemes drawn from Japanese, Korean, a smattering of Chinese dialects and a smidgen of Vietnamese embedded in a largely Classical Chinese matrix. There are a handful of particles that act as case endings that are imported from Japanese, and the script is Hangul, the script invented in Korea, but Vietnamese involvement is minimal short of a few token lexemes and the fact that the Romanisation is bafflingly one syllable per space-separated word.</p>
<p>As with its source languages, the script is written in square blocks, with options to write horizontally and vertically. The script is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_mixed_script">Korean mixed script</a>, where Chinese characters are employed to write lexemes – content words – and grammatical particles and conjunctions are written in Hangul. There is quite a lot of variation and leeway as to which word is written as which script, but it was advised in the source book that Chinese characters are to be used as far as possible to increase interoperability across the region.</p>
<p>The Latin script is also adopted as an official script, which was intended to replace the characters after Westernisation but such a thing never happened and now the Latin script is merely a conventional way to translate names into langauges using Latin-based scripts. Yuu Manr has ignored some of the subtleties of the Latin characters in favour of convenience in transliteration, as a manner of attempting to establish an East Asian identity separate from the West while still enabling exchange with them.</p>

<p>A particularly unusual drawl in some unspecified location in the British Isles have brought forth this highly aberrant language, which while clearly descended from English has been altered so extensively that there are no doubts that it is a completely separate language.</p>
