![A map of Ùzje.](img/main-map.png)

In the year 1842, a sleepy fishing town in the south of China
was captured by the British over something about drugs.
A hundred and fifty years on,
the town has grown to be the home of seven million inhabitants
and so much money and political clout
that it has become the world's most country-like region
that isn't actually isn't a country.
On the 25th of March, 1990,
the archipelago was declared to be a joint administration zone
where it is simultaneously both part of its colonial parent
and its geographical parent in perpetuity,
an evolution which has been talked about since the late 1970s
after various rebellions.

As a result, Ùzje is an interesting city-state,
product of many thousands of years of Chinese neglect
and several decades of intense British exploitation.
Though it claims to be a place where east meets west,
the claim is largely a PR statement with little in the way to back it up.
For instance, although most official items are bilingual,
including road signs, documents, officials and the Law Establishment House,
the only *real* language that is spoken in these fair isles is Man Gog Yuu,
a Chinese variety that some enterprising fellow not so far in the north
has created as a rebellion to the fading Chinese empire
in the turn of the 20th century.
The region's other language, g'Mòdyfäjq, is imposed by the colonials,
and while it has become the prestige dialect of the region,
it is largely ignored by the public.

Though the British may not have caught the public of Ùzje by their tongue,
they certainly have caught them by their actions:
drivers drive on the left, commuters stand on the right on escalators,
and above all there are massive queues for everything
and a hundred and one unwritten rules about it.
Even some of the flora and fauna of the UK was imported in here
in hopes of making the place homely,
but not many of the imported species
managed to last very long in the sweltering heat,
which in retrospect was not the worst outcome for such an introduction.
It definitely kept the region's biodiversity largely untouched.

The colony was built to be a financial capital from the get go.
Initially it was just to import narcotics to the empire to the north,
but eventually it was a great staging ground to the rest of East Asia,
and the city eventually grew its container and storage ports
until it is largely unparallelled throughout the region.
Eventually banks and factories moved in,
exploiting the region's great interconnectivity.
But despite their almost criminal influence over the local government,
and all their wishes that the currency of the region
can move beyond the archaic systems of pounds, shillings and pence,
Ùzje's pound, the UJP, remains a non-decimal currency,
although the financial sector have attempted to decimalise,
and therefore some currency values are almost exclusively used by them.

For all its faults Ùzje remains an attractive tourist destination,
whether it's just for sightseeing
or if it's for establishment of slightly shady shell companies.
Tourists love the food, the lights, and the excellent wilderness,
whereas the low tax rates and strong connections
make it a great spot for many businesses to set foot.
The only ones that don't really benefit very much from this affair
are the long-standing and long-suffering inhabitants of these very isles,
who have to put up with the whims of three kings
and the demands of half a dozen more cultural expectations
imported from all over the world.
But hey, at least they get pretty good healthcare.

# Essentials #
## Language ##
Ùzje is, according to its Basic Law, a bilingual region.
The two languages are **Man Gog Yuu** and **g'Mòdyfäjq**.
However, the actual bilingualism of the place is somewhat questionable,
as mentioned above.

Invented by enterprising idealist Jjan Yuu Manr some time in the late 1890s
and published on 1901-05-06 in Canton,
Man Gog Yuu is an auxiliary language that attempts to be the common language
of all of East Asia,
although it was originally built to be a language
for use of the anti-imperial rebellion.
Unlike certain similar movements in Europe,
this one grew to be surprisingly successful,
but the reach is still not as far as the creator would have hoped;
it has become the administrative language of the South China region for sure,
as well as strongholds in northern Vietnam and some parts of Taiwan and Ryukyu,
but it spread was hampered in Korea and Japan
and it's actively being suppressed in the North.

As one can expect it is largely a few lexemes drawn from Japanese, Korean,
a smattering of Chinese dialects and a smidgen of Vietnamese
embedded in a largely Classical Chinese matrix.
There are a handful of particles that act as case endings
that are imported from Japanese,
and the script is Hangul, the script invented in Korea,
but Vietnamese involvement is minimal short of a few token lexemes
and the fact that the Romanisation is bafflingly
one syllable per space-separated word.

As with its source languages, the script is written in square blocks,
with options to write horizontally and vertically.
The script is [Korean mixed script][],
where Chinese characters are employed to write lexemes – content words –
and grammatical particles and conjunctions are written in Hangul.
There is quite a lot of variation and leeway
as to which word is written as which script,
but it was advised in the source book
that Chinese characters are to be used as far as possible
to increase interoperability across the region.

The Latin script is also adopted as an official script,
which was intended to replace the characters after Westernisation
but such a thing never happened
and now the Latin script is merely a conventional way to translate names
into langauges using Latin-based scripts.
Yuu Manr has ignored some of the subtleties of the Latin characters
in favour of convenience in transliteration,
as a manner of attempting to establish an East Asian identity
separate from the West while still enabling exchange with them.

A particularly unusual drawl in some unspecified location in the British Isles
have brought forth this highly aberrant language,
which while clearly descended from English has been altered so extensively
that there are no doubts that it is a completely separate language.
There are some speculations that the radical and at times implausible changes
are a product of conscious change rather than unconscious wandering,
but such claims have never been supported with evidence,
short of a few sporadic word derivation systems here and there.

The language has a special relationship with English,
which exists elsewhere in the remnants of the British Empire.
There is a one-way system for translating English words into g'Mòdyfäjq,
which is called c'preq.
The "translation"'s goal is not to import the word into g'Mòdyfäjq,
but to make an alternate version of the word
that has features and qualities unique to g'Mòdyfäjq.
This system grew out of an in-joke of sorts
that has spread to become part of the standard language
and there is sufficient evidence in the way of written records
to confirm that this feature at least
is a deliberate and conscious addition to the language.
The alternate orthography, which is in Cyrillic,
provides further obfuscation and is another invention.

g'Mòdyfäjq has been selected as the colonial language of the region
rather than English proper because Ùzje has never really been a normal colony.
First of all, there are several interesting characters
that were appointed as governors of the region –
specifically, those who are privy to the business regarding g'Mòdyfäjq
and are sympathetic to it for various reasons,
not least of which is that one of them is a spearhead of the language itself.
Another key fact is that Ùzje has always been somewhat rebellious
and wishes to be independent in some way or another,
and granting them a separate language
is a very easy way to placate the colonials that have found their way there.
Finally the fact that Ùzje is such an established based for g'Mòdyfäjq speakers
have ensured that the place will become attractive for more g'Mòdyfäjq speakers,
making a feedback loop that all ends up with it being the official language
over English.

However g'Mòdyfäjq has never been that popular outside of the aristocratic elite
and therefore in the street
apart from a few compulsory lessons and some rare cases
the language is largely unspoken.
There had been grumbles that English should be adopted over all,
but those proposals have never made it into the polls, for whatever reason.
There are also government-subsidised courses
that teach translating English to g'Mòdyfäjq but those rarely get attendence.

g'Mòdyfäjq has shown itself elsewhere the remainders of the Empire as well,
with established speaking communities in Australia and New Zealand,
as well as isolated pockets in New Columbia.
Its usage outside of Anglosphere-dominated areas is virtually unheard-of,
though a few significant exceptions exist in the Netherlands
and parts of ex-Colonial Africa.

### Other languages ###
The source languages of g'Mòdyfäjq and Man Gog Yuu,
which are English, and the varieties of Chinese and Japanese repsectively,
still do have some presence in Ùzje
but are significantly muted in favour of the two official languages.
However place names in g'Mòdyfäjq
are derived mostly from the corresponding Cantonese place names,
rather than through their Man Gog Yuu pronunciations.
This sometimes results in places where the g'Mòdyfäjq name
can sometimes distinguish names while the Man Gog Yuu name cannot.

Apart from those, a smattering of other languages have significant minorities.
On the Asian side we have immigrants (and/or invaders) from Japan and Korea
that have came in through their Man Gog Yuu speaking credentials
but have also brought their native languages along;
the local market for domestic helpers have brought Indonesian and Tagalog,
as well as the various languages in India;
and there's also a handful of Vietnamese speakers,
enough for them to form a newspaper.
On the European front, there's German, Dutch, French and Spanish,
in decreasing order of speaking population.
Most of these speakers, Asian and European,
also speak one of the two official languages,
due to the government heavily promoting them.

## Currency and Pricing ##
The Ùzje Pound (£ or U£) is a non-decimal currency.
It is based on the British currency of the same name,
and is also divided the same way –
twelve pence make a shilling, twenty of which make a pound.
The penny is also divided into four farthings,
but in general only halfpennies are used.

<aside>
    SI multiples can also appear next to pounds,
    but only the multiplicative (> 1) ones and only informally.
    SI multiples may never be used on shillings.
</aside>

In response to decimalisation, one thousand pennies also make a kilopenny (kd).
One kilopenny is equal to two pounds, three shillings and fourpence.
Although heavily used in the financial sector,
the kilopenny has never found much use outside of it
apart from some commemorative currency and as a price point.
Further SI multiples may be used, resulting in Md, Gd, Td, and so on.
Diminutive multiples are rare, except for the millipenny (md),
which is the trading currency used in the Ùzje stock market.

The standard method of writing a currency in pounds-shillings-pence
is to write separate the three units with slashes or short horizontal lines,
and sandwich the entire expression in (U)£…(d),
so for instance the kilopenny is written as £2/3/4d or U£2–3–4.
However, there is significant variation in practise,
and the format is also written £2 3s 4d, £2+3/4 or even 43′ 4″.

The kilopenny family of values have a slightly different way of notation.
A number, which is either an integer
or a decimal with a multiple of three decimal places
is then followed by a space then the unit.
One pound, which is equal to 240 d, is then either written as such,
or as 0.240 kd, 0.000 240 Md, and so on and so forth.
Note that 250 md is a farthing, but 250 Md is one billion farthings,
which is equal to U£1 041 666/13/4,
so while case distinction is significant
there is *usually* enough context to distinguish the two.

Fast food                                   2    3

Food is usually pretty affordable and reasonable here,
as long as one either sticks to fast food and local cuisine.
These are typically found in less touristy places (of course)
and are family-run.
The taste is generally agreeable to all,
though for the more adventurous eaters there are exotic meals available
near Zestəq Tel.

Taxi per 30 seconds                                  2

Transport is inexpensive and plentiful.
The relatively small area of Ùzje combined with (mostly) agreeable terrain
makes it very easy for a public transport system to flourish and grow.
That having been said, the roads are plenty wide,
and apart from the perpetual and inevitable problem of finding car space
and the noticeably expensive petrol tax
private cars are largely pleasurable to use in the territory.
However, cyclists beware, as bike hiring is exorbitant
and it might be better to buy or bring your own bike.

Flat (100 m²) sale price             15 1250
House (100 m²) sale price           120

If you're living here, the rent would be completely unreasonable,
but if it's just for a stay in the hotels then Ùzje lets up a little.
As with most Asian countries, the lack of land suitable for city-building
has led to many compact designs, including the budget "capsule hotel",
which is little more than a 275 × 150 cm bed and an enclosure.

Although prices are here given in pounds,
it is a custom of the real estates agency to print prices in megapence
with pounds being secondary. 1 Md = £4166/13/4, but usually to make things easier
prices are in multiples of 3 Md = £12500 exactly.

# Getting in #
## By air ##
By far the most popular way to get into Ùzje
is through the gargantuan Þrulaqt-Pleqhevəq ə'Ùzje – Ùzje International Airport.
The five-runway, three-terminal airport is placed on the edge of the territory,
directly next to the western end of the M4
and accessed via the A550 to A555 roads.
It handles aeroplane movement (takeoff or landing)
once every twenty to thirty seconds,
resulting in a yearly throughput of about 700,000 flights, or 24 MU.

Navigation throughout the airport is relatively simple if somewhat tiring
due to its massive size.
The signs are usually adequate, although there are a few trouble spots
where a sign might be ambiguous or absent.
The roads around the airport are a bit of a maze
and require close attention to signage or a good GPS.
The parking is a little bit inadequate for airports of its size,
and there isn't much of a car rental service either.

For such a large airport the landside (before security) area
is curiously undersized, especially for the oldest terminal;
this is because the government was expecting that tourists
would go to nearby Szajmej to do their last- (or first-) minute shopping,
confident that the prices in an urban and residential area
would be much closer to the prices in the airport area
and therefore spending more.
The two places are literally on either side of the M4,
and a dedicated shuttle service and driverless train service
moves tourists between them.

Security is largely painless,
or at least as painless as the international authroities can allow;
immigration for locals are convenient and electronic
but for those who *really* don't want
to hand over their fingerprints to the government
a manual service is available.
Past security there is a much more sizeable collection of shops –
going back to Szajmej is no longer an option –
and a couple of automated trains
connecting the airside areas of the terminals together.

## By land and sea ##
The M1 and M8 connect Ùzje to China, and the M4 connects it to Damdsaj.
These are the only land routes to Ùzje,
but they are very robust and can withstand the strongest of storms.
All three are guarded by checkpoints,
because Ùzje runs its own customs and immigration service.
There's no major crossover problem –
both China and Damdsaj drive on the left,
and have the steering wheel on the right.

Queues might be another problem though –
on average more than a hundred thousand vehicles pass through the border
and most of them all have to go under customs and immigration checks.
This results in massive queues in the busiest hours
and a giant waiting park on both sides of the bridges.

If you don't drive, or have hazardous materials that are unsuitable for bridges,
then you must enter via the ferries.
There are ferries coming in the same places where the bridges go to –
north to China, and west to Damdsaj.
However, truckers commanding hazardous chemicals
will have to ride car ferries from the north,
docking in Moŋdej in and rejoining the main car traffic on the M3.

# Getting around #
The size of Ùzje makes it an excellent place to build public transport,
and it has one of the world's most affordable and extensive schemes in the world.
Here's a whirlwind tour of its network.

## The Ùzje Metro ##
![A map of the Ùzje Metro system.](img/metro.png)

Locally known as the UJTL or the S/Ù,
the Ùzje Metro was proposed shortly after the riots
to appeal to the concerns of the increasingly unsatisfied populace.
Though at first it was derided as a white elephant,
it has soon proved itself to be the crown jewel of the transport network.
With nine lines spanning over a hundred stations,
the network serves all city centres of the territory
and a handful of other places too.

The metro was built in stages,
starting from a section of the LZT and the LCJ.
The overall plan has, while adapted to the changing realities of development,
never strayed far from the original vision:
two lines that circulate around the Lokcəxn Peninsula,
a line up to the north, a line up to the east, a line up to the west,
a line across the south, and a line to connect them all up to the airport.

The metro system is nothing short of delightful
compared to the rest of the world.
All stations and trains are air-conditioned
(which is a near-essential in this sweltering city),
and the trains run as often as once per 40 seconds at rush hour.
Cost is extremely reasonable at an average distance cost of 350 µd/m (2.9 km/d).

As it currently stands the metro is incomplete;
a lot of stations are under planning
and many plots of land are left empty for future development.
There's no guarantee that the development will ever come;
recently the construction has drawn the ire of many locals
who think the economic benefit of the metro coming to them
is not enough to balance the losses that come with it.
However, for the tourist,
the metro provides a great whirlwind tour of the territory.

## Boan Tramways ##
<!-- Map of the network here. -->
With over 330 stops all across the north shore of Boan Isle, the Boan Tramway
provides an irresistibly cheap and convenient transport option for all those who
live near it. Regular customers love it for its convenient station density and
unbeatable prices; tourists love it for its slow, down-to-Earth alternative to
the fast-paced city that it serves.

Founded in 1904, the network was built in stages starting from Grot-Arzeqt.
All of it is double-tracked, with one set of tracks in each direction,
with some particularly busy sections getting another set of tracks.
Usually the extra set of tracks are placed on the edge of the road
where the original set of tracks are at the centre.

The trams are all very old, over forty years old in some cases,
and they are all double-deck and seat about 120.
While they have a top speed of about 60 km/h,
going anything over 40 km/h in one of the tramcars
is a truly hair-raising experience for the riders.

Most tram cars are non-air-conditioned,
making them fairly unpopular in the summer months.
Air-conditioned trams are slightly more expensive than non-air-conditioned ones,
but in either case the prices are nearly impossibly low:
3d is the most that one journey can charge you,
and there are concession fares for everyone and everything.
(No monthly or annual passes though, that's not a thing yet).
It is primarily propped up by the elderly and the prodigious amount of tourists,
with some help by the public sector to preserve the system as it is.

Tram tracks run on the road for the most part,
giving the passengers a close-up view of life on the streets of Boan Ajł.
However, some parts of the network *do* run on their own right-of-way,
for instance in ð'Crantanel, which is as its name suggests a tram tunnel.

## The Light Rail ##
<!-- Map of the light rail here. -->
Meanwhile on the other side of ð'Qabar,
a newer, fully air-conditioned and even more sprawling Light Rail Network
sprawls across Zestəq Tel.
These are like trams in function but very different in form:
they are modern, single-deck, double-car articulated trains
with some element of premetro systems
as a significant amount of its track is under dedicated right of way.
