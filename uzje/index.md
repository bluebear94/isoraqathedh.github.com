In the year 1842, a sleepy fishing town in the south of China
was captured by the British over something about drugs.
A hundred and fifty years on,
the town has grown to be the home of seven million inhabitants
and so much money and political clout
that it has become the world's most country-like region
that isn't actually isn't a country.
On the 25th of March, 1990,
the archipelago was declared to be a joint administration zone
where it is simultaneously both part of its colonial parent
and its geographical parent in perpetuity,
an evolution which has been talked about since the late 1970s
after various rebellions.

As a result, Ùzje is an interesting city-state,
product of many thousands of years of Chinese neglect
and several decades of intense British exploitation.
Though it claims to be a place where east meets west,
the claim is largely a PR statement with little in the way to back it up.
For instance, although most official items are bilingual,
including road signs, documents, officials and the Law Establishment House,
the only *real* language that is spoken in these fair isles is Man Gog Yuu,
a Chinese variety that some enterprising fellow not so far in the north
has created as a rebellion to the fading Chinese empire
in the close of the 19th century.
The region's other language, g'Mòdyfäjq, is imposed by the colonials,
and while it has become the prestige dialect of the region,
it is largely ignored by the public.

Though the British may not have caught the public of Ùzje by their tongue,
they certainly have caught them by their actions:
drivers drive on the left, commuters stand on the right on escalators,
and above all there are massive queues for everything
and a hundred and one unwritten rules about it.
Even some of the flora and fauna of the UK was imported in here
in hopes of making the place homely,
but not many of the imported species
managed to last very long in the sweltering heat,
which in retrospect was not the worst outcome for such an introduction.
It definitely kept the region's biodiversity largely untouched.

The colony was built to be a financial capital from the get go.
Initially it was just to import narcotics to the empire to the north,
but eventually it was a great staging ground to the rest of East Asia,
and the city eventually grew its container and storage ports
until it is largely unparallelled throughout the region.
Eventually banks and factories moved in,
exploiting the region's great interconnectivity.
But despite their almost criminal influence over the local government,
and all their wishes that the currency of the region
can move beyond the archaic systems of pounds, shillings and pence,
Ùzje's pound, the UJP, remains a non-decimal currency,
although the financial sector adopted SI prefixes for the UJP's smallest unit,
resulting in kilopence, megapence, gigapence, &c. –
currency values that are almost exclusively used by them.

For all its faults Ùzje remains an attractive tourist destination,
whether it's just for sightseeing
or if it's for establishment of slightly shady shell companies.
Tourists love the food, the lights, and the excellent wilderness,
whereas the low tax rates and strong connections
make it a great spot for many businesses to set foot.
The only ones that don't really benefit very much from this affair
are the long-standing and long-suffering inhabitants of these very isles,
who have to put up with the whims of three kings
and the demands of half a dozen more cultural expectations
imported from all over the world.
But hey, at least they get pretty good healthcare.
