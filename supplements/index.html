<h1 id="Title">On Circle Constants</h1>
<p>
    There had been a lot of duscussion about circle constants and which ones are used.
    Below are the results of discussion by the various planetary parliaments, and their results.
</p>
<h1>Pseudo</h1>
<p>
    Pseudo uses the ratio between the circumference of the circle and its diameter as the circle
    constant (C:d).
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        [...] while the ratio C:r gains credence due to its heavy application in advanced
		mathematics
        [...] we must not forget the cultural roots of mathematics, esentially its basis in the 
        real world. [...] It is abundantly clear that d has more usage in practical terms, like
        drums and tree trunks [...]

<h1>Circular</h1>
<p>
    Circular uses C:r as the circle constant.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        C:r is akin to many other faculties of mathematics, esp. that of a sphere's A:r and V:r
        [...] usage of C:r is consistent with other units, e.g. the period of f(x) = sin x,
        cos x [...] that f(x) = e<sup>ix</sup> has semiperiod [antiperiod] (C:r)/2 is 
        equally fitting.

<h1>Quaxtion</h1>
<p>
    Quaxtion uses the ratio of the surface area of the unit sphere to the surface area of a 
    unit square. This is equal to four times C:d.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        [...] Even as we are, we exist in a three-dimensional world. That alone is enough to at 
        least consider the ratio A:r of a sphere. [...] By using A:r, a lot ofequations can 
        simplify, such as F = 1/(4πε<sub>0</sub>) (Qq/r²) and ħ = h/(2π). [...] The inverse
        square law, indispensible to all physics, is simply understood with a proportionality 
        constant being a multiple instead of a multiple of a multiple [...] The computational 
        power between conversion of cricle constants is trivial[...]

<h1>Xaxex</h1>
<p>
    Xaxex takes the approach of adopting both C:r and C:d and instructs citizens to use them 
    as appropriate.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        [...] a five-day-long discussion amonst multiple parties, among which there are
        mathematicians, linguists and engineers, failed to yield any single answer. It is suggested,
        therefore, taht there is enough room for both circle constants to be used. The statement
        is "use C:d if it is simple to do so, and use C:r if it is simple to do so." [...] both
        constants, and their pragmatic usage, will be introduced to governmental education
        with immediate effect. [...]

<h1>The United Front</h1>
<p>
    The United Front is the general statment of all four planets. It does not endorse any
    circle constant.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        We live [...] in a varied world, perhaps too much so for any all-encompassing standards.
        [...] Even in the pure world of mathematics, there are tints of culture, both intrinsically,
        and in its expression [...] With the above in mind, and also considering the [highly] severe
        computational power we have today, we [...] will explicitly disclaim any statment endorsing
        or disparaging the (non-)usage of any (combination) of circle constants, be it C;r, C;d,
        A:r, or any others. [...] No claim of any mathematical standards with Imperial scope shall
        have any executive effect beginning immediately.
