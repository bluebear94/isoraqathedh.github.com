<h1 id="Title">Introduction to Egonyota Pasaru</h1>
<p>
	Egonyota Pasaru (EP) is the primary langauge of communication in the Pseudoan Empire. It is the
	one that (usually) gets top billing in language lists, and it is one of the four languages that
	must be chosen in an education schema. It also is the first on the list of the Four Standard
	Languages, along with Serakafph Xaxex (SX), Cipogrtesaj (Ct) and yukũa|Elaga ütæk|Qvalsa (EQ).
</p>
<p>
	EP was born as Egonyota Vohalyosun (E. Vhs), a relatively average eastern bulillan language
	family; the family is famous for being agglutinative weakly, and also the extreme rarity of
	possessing a maje-, meso- and miniscule script. It transformed into Egonyota Pasaru – the
	representative language of the planet – through smallish reforms to some of its more arcane
	aspect (e.g. bracket subordinates). A consensus was reached 71 545 PDN, after a 100-year-long
	pocess of reforms, revisions and rehashes.
</p>
<p>
	EP has a very simple VSO PMT system along with #NA and a flexible verb-adverb relationship. The
	language borrows heavily and lends even more, which is not surprising given its status.
</p>
<p>
	EP has a governing authority but it does not regulate the language – the society is very
	descriptive and issues a yearly report on changes on the language (yearly +
	relativity-breaking-magic, of course…) The authority does make annual standardised tests of
	all sorts around the year, but in limited supply since they aren't required to indicate
	procifiency of a language (and no one cares about them save a tiny niche anyway.)
