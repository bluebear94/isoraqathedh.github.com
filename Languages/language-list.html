<p>Below is a list of languages that I maintain. It supersedes <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/post/104459911185/blurbs-for-all-the-languages">this post</a> and <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/language-list">this page</a>, both of which I shall leave up to maintain links. However, the second page has been edited to only show a link to this page.</p>
<h1 id="the-four-languages-of-the-jesdic-pasaru">The Four Languages of the Jesdic Pasaru</h1>
<ol class="example" type="1">
<li>The official language of the Jesdic Pasaru, <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Egonyota-Pasaru"><strong>Egonyota Pasaru</strong></a> is the one language you must learn to truly experience life in the Empire. It is the lingua franca of the Empire and its periphery, for certain definitions of “periphery”.</li>
<li>The international language of the planet that bears its name, <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Serakafph-Xaxex"><strong>Serakafph Xaxex</strong></a> is well known for its rich array of metaphor and figurative speech that compensates for its simplistic grammar that recurses poorly.</li>
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Yuk%C5%A9a%7Celaga-%C3%BCt%C3%A6k%7CQva%E1%B8%BBsa"><strong>Elaga Qvaḻsa</strong></a>, once based on phonemes and other mouth-related words, has long since abandoned its spoken roots and is now entirely a “written” language encoded into numbers rather than as letters. It still retains its spoken heritage, through its intricate system of “letters” interacting with each other.</li>
<li>A simple language for practical units, <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Cipogrtesaj"><strong>Cipogrtesaj</strong></a> is the language for when you feel like putting all modifiers after the main sentence. It has as many vowels as it does consonants, something borne out of its highly diverse speaking population, crossing not just civilization boundaries but species boundaries.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="other-languages-in-the-jesdic-pasaru">Other languages in the Jesdic Pasaru</h1>
<p>These have grown to be so numerous that they are now divided by planet.</p>
<h2 id="pasaru-a.k.a-pseudo">Pasaru (a.k.a Pseudo)</h2>
<ol start="5" class="example" type="1">
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Yoskrai"><strong>Yoskrail</strong></a> is the programmer’s cant, a language that outwardly resembles a programming language yet contains enough concessions to make it usable for ordinary speech (and also make it become not a programming language). Spoken primarily in the isolated yet highly connected burrows of (J)erso and the surrounding ocean (now a mountain due to continental drift), it sports indenting, lexical blocks and an infinite supply of variables.</li>
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Hesmai-Iok"><strong>Hesmai Iok</strong></a> is a language that pulls its weight in Fenegil. It has an intense ȝender system that both nouns and verbs use, and they interact in manners most convoluted. It also has a most singular lexicographical ordering that uses a length-55 vector to determine order.</li>
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/%C3%82agenzb%C3%A8e"><strong>Âagenzbèe</strong></a> is the Old Tongue of the northern lands of Pseudo. Outsiders will immediately recognize it by the language’s distinct usage of hand gestures as distinguished phonemes, a trait that it has passed on to its descendents who have changed it in many strange and wonderful ways.</li>
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Cindri"><strong>Cindri</strong></a> is a language spoken in the islands far to the north of Pseudo. It is known for its unique feature of having a knitted representation in lieu of a written one.</li>
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/search/Gwa-elohba" title="Linking the tag doesn&#39;t work. Really, Tumblr!"><strong>Gwa-elohba</strong></a> is the national language of Rija, and is a cousin of Cindri and a descendent of Âagenzbèe. It can be considered as a “missing link” between those two languages. Its most notable feature is that it has great dialectal variation due to its unique geopolitical situation.</li>
<li>The administrative language of the Jesdic Senlis, <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Rattssaw"><strong>Rattssaw</strong></a> is well known for its tricky application of phonemic prevocalisation (written using # for that matter), heavy use of tu-vous and strange loops in its registers.</li>
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Nnn-Heeel"><strong>Nnn Heeel</strong></a> is the result of a language that has lived too close to Rattssaw. Primarily, the effect is that it has drawn out a lot of its letters to three times the usual length. Grammar-wise it prides itself on being the exact reverse of Rattssaw, piling a ton of morphemes onto the noun and with verbs being largely isolating. It also has an extremely awkward number system.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="xaxex">Xaxex</h2>
<ol start="12" class="example" type="1">
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Sekapon"><strong>Sekapon</strong></a> is the language of South Abeĉo. It’s well known for its multiple script system, which resembles a souped-up version of Japanese with no fewer than four scripts pulling their individual weight.</li>
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Ouduec-Fxelw"><strong>Ouduec Fxelw</strong></a> has a large phonetic inventory and is spoken in North Abeĉo. It boasts an amazingly compact script that’s alphabetic with minor logographic and syllabic aspirations, as well as a vaguely Arabic bent. The actual language is far from Arabic though, and is in fact generative from the ground up, with the language composed of several very explicit building blocks that replace one another until the meaning is expressible. This makes it easy to construct by a computer, but of course there are other obstacles to natural language processing, even with this language.</li>
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/search/Ya-k%C4%95naj" title="Same problem with Gwa-elohba. It seems like hyphens are a sticking point"><strong>Ya-kĕnaj</strong></a> is a programmer’s cant similar but not exactly the same as Yoskrail. It has the most infuriating property of basing its syntax not on a tree but on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue">double-ended queue</a>, which makes for extremely flexible yet utterly rigid syntax and the idea of a “word operator” that doesn’t say anything solid but rather operate on the deque directly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<ol start="15" class="example" type="1">
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Uvbraot"><strong>Uvbraot</strong></a> dials down the weirdness of almost all of its sister languages, but still contains alien concepts for English speakers such as backgrounding sentences, and half-classes.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="the-purple-languages">The Purple Languages</h1>
<p>(The Purple Languages are the languages that do not explicitly belong to the Jesdic Pasaru in any official manner. Of course, the way that the Jesdic Pasaru works, all of these languages belong to the Jesdic in some way, but not explicitly!)</p>
<p>(Oh, they’re called the Purple Languages because they are written in a purple notebook.)</p>
<ol start="16" class="example" type="1">
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/Man-gog-yuu"><strong>Man gog yuu</strong></a> is an Esperanto for East Asian languages, warts and all. It attempts to create a synthesis of Japanese, (the various languages of) Chinese, Korean and even Vietnamese into a primarily Classical Chinese matrix. Along the way, many, many brutal compromises were made, creating a language that sounds, looks, and even thinks differently from any of the source languages. Quite a “compromise”!</li>
<li><a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/ABGTA"><strong>Altrvukaif</strong></a> (no tag of its own; this one links to its parent project, “A Beginner’s Guide to Alternia”) cannot claim to be the ancestor of all i·umën languages, although contains the obvious marks of a being a language of a group of somebodies who created i·umëns and the languages that go with i·umëns. Still, i·umën speakers beware, for this language has more levels of respect and emotion sensitivity than any you might have heard of.</li>
<li><strong>Ỳŋlys g’mòdyfäjt vð’Fäqdəq</strong>, commonly abbreviated to <a href="http://isoraqathedh.tumblr.com/tagged/g&#39;M%C3%B2dyf%C3%A4jq"><strong>g’Mòdyfäjq</strong></a>, is a somewhat conservative alteration of English that seeks to brutally alter the phonology and especially the orthography in hopes that it will blend the names of characters and other objects in popular fiction to something at the edge of recognition. The grammar is also slightly affected, but other than a few token oddities it’s still recognisably Germanic.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="other-languages">Other languages</h1>
<p>These languages are incomplete, immature or otherwise simply old and left unfinished. They may graduate out of this list to become full languages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>→</strong> is a tiny language fragment that only defines one verb, “becomes”, written as →. It has no means to form any part of speech and relies on other languages to donate their own. No other verbs are defined, but arrows can be chained to express continuity; furthermore there are additional helper constructs, such as brackets, to express complex concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Egonyota Bulilla</strong> and <strong>Egonyota Vohalyosun</strong> are planned ancestors of Egonyota Pasaru.</li>
<li><strong>Rðƿa</strong> is an old language that attempts to mix Chinese and English. It is currently undeveloped and will probably remain so.</li>
</ul>
