  <h1 id="Title">Syllabic Denial</h1>
  <p>
    Are you a young language? Do you think that syllables are for squares?
    Do you want to try some other ways of joining up phonemes together?
    If so, then syllabic denial is right for you.
    In syllabic denial, the idea of a syllable is replaced
    by a concept called a <dfn>phonorun</dfn>,
    (sometimes called a <dfn>run</dfn> for short).
    This document explains how a language works with phonoruns in a Q&amp;A format.
  </p>
  <h1>Usage and prevalence</h1>
  <h3>Come on. Syllables are universal right?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, bar some particularly interesting examples in the American Northwest.
    But that doesn't mean that you can make up something different yourself.
    It should be noted that even among Earthling languages,
    the idea of what makes a syllable and what doesn't remains contentious
    and doesn't stay constant cross-linguistically.
    The idea of phonoruns are just to pull it all apart
    and try moving in a different direction for a change.
  </p>
  <h3>How can you tell if a language uses phonoruns?</h3>
  <p>
    Generally you can tell by its prosody (see below).
    However for a first glance,
    if the language seems to have a lot of convoluted consonant clusters
    and similar lengths of vowel clusters,
    you have good reason to believe that it is a language that uses phonoruns.
  </p>
  <h3>Do you have a language that can demonstrate phonoruns?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Throughout this document, I will refer to my conlang, Rattssaw,
    which explicitly uses phonoruns to cut up its words.
    Rattssaw calls itself <span lang="art-x-Rs">#rattssá</span>.
    All Rattssaw words will be written in italics.
  </p>
  <h1>Basic details</h1>
  <h3>What is a phonorun?</h3>
  <p>
    A phonorun is simply a combination of phonemes
    that share some specific properties.
  </p>
  <h3>Where did you get that name from?</h3>
  <p>
    I made it up. Natural languages generally don't use this system,
    so there's no reason for linguists to give it an official name.
  </p>
  <h3>What's these properties then?</h3>
  <p>There are two types of properties: intrinsic and extrinsic.</p>
  <p>
    Intrinsic properties are properties that the phoneme has by itself:
    voicing, place of articulation, manner of articulation, vowelness, consonantness etc..
    On the other hand, extrinsic properties are assigned by the language itself
    and doesn't have to correspond to any particular quality of the consonant or vowel.
  </p>
  <p>Rattssaw uses an extrinsic property to divide its phonemes into three different types.</p>
  <table>
    <thead><tr>
      <th>Name (en)</th>
      <th>Name (Rs)</th>
      <th>Members</th>
    </tr></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Open</td><td lang="art-x-Rs">þhaər</td>
        <td>Exactly the phonemes «a e i o u á é ó ay wá yé h»</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Closed</td><td lang="art-x-Rs">skkdþ</td>
        <td>Exactly the phonemes «p b t d pp bb tt dd þ f ff k g kk j ss #»</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Inheritable</td><td lang="art-x-Rs">fflayer</td>
        <td>All other phonemes, that is «l r rr þþ z s f x ś m n ng»</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    For now, using the orthography is sufficient in understanding how phonoruns work,
    so listing their IPA values is superfluous.
    Yes, even #, which unhelpfully has the IPA variable symbol /#/ for its value.
  </p>
  <h3>Can you have other types of division then?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Alternative methods of splitting up a phonemes of a language include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Voiced and unvoiced phonemes.
      These languages often have unvoiced vowels (usually just one, notated /ə̊/).
    </li>
    <li>
      Front, mid and back phonemes.
      For vowels these are obvious;
      for consonants front usually means dental/labial, middle usually means alveolar
      and back usually means anything further back than velar
    </li>
    <li>
      High and low phonemes.
      Again for vowels this is easy;
      for consonants this usually concerns their manner of articulation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pulmonic and non-pulmonic phonemes.
      Rare because non-pulmonics are rare and hard to string together.
    </li>
    <li>
      Random assignment. This is known in precisely one (as of yet undocumented) language,
      which has weird properties anyway.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Can I have multiple properties to divide upon?</h3>
  <p>
    Theoretically this is possible, but this multiplies the complexity
    and therefore it's much rarer.
  </p>
  <h3>What does "inheritable" mean?</h3>
  <p>
    It means that the letter changes category to conform to the previous letter.
    For example, in the word <span lang="art-x-Rs">ael</span> (eat),
    the l is open to conform to the open e,
    but in the word <span lang="art-x-Rs">clt</span> (modify, alter)
    The l is closed to conform to the closed c.
    The inheritable class is compatible with all methods of categorization
    and indeed is fairly common cross-linguistically.
  </p>
  <h1>Describing phonoruns</h1>
  <h3>What is the equivalent to syl-lab-i-fi-ca-tion?</h3>
  <p>
    That would be a word's <dfn>signature</dfn>.
    There are many different types of signature, but these two are the most common ones,
    operated on the word "<span lang="art-x-Rs">#rattssá"</span>
    , "<span lang="art-x-Rs">#r-a-ttss-á</span>".
  </p>
  <p>
    The most common system comes from first writing out each run descriptively:
    <code>Closed 2, Open 1, Closed 2, Open 1</code>, and then condensing it down to
    <code>C2O1C2O1C2O1</code>.
    Taking advantage of the fact that any change in run
    also indicates a change from open to closed or vice-versa,
    we can then write <strong><code>C2121</code></strong>,
    which is the first form.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second form instead focuses on the boundaries of each run,
    so we write <code>2, rise, 1, fall, 2, rise, 1</code>.
    This can be intelligibly shortened to <strong><code>2/1\2/1</code></strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With other languages, which may have more chategories,
    alternate systems can develop. However, Rattssaw has no need for these.
  </p>
  <h3>What do you call each of the bits of a phonorun, like how a syllable has onsets, rimes, etc.?</h3>
  <p>
    Phonoruns have no structure inside them,
    so a lot of the terminology that comes with them
    tend to revolve around how they interact with each other
    and with the word that they live in.
    Below are a sampling of terms.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Closed-start (<span lang="art-x-Rs">gtt kksuər</span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      A word that begins with a run of closed phonemes,
      as in the word <span lang="art-x-Rs">csunə</span> (the letter C),
      whose signature is <code><strong>C</strong>23</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Closed-end (<span lang="art-x-Rs">gtt élwóuppś</span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      A word that ends with a run of closed phonemes,
      as in the word <span lang="art-x-Rs">islkk</span> (the letter I),
      whose signature is <code>O1<strong>3</strong></code>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Open-start (<span lang="art-x-Rs">oiw kksuər</span>)</dt>
    <dt>Open-end (<span lang="art-x-Rs">oiw élwóuppś</span>)</dt>
    <dd> Analogous to closed-start and closed-end but for runs of open phonemes.</dd>
    <dt>Rising edge (<span lang="art-x-Rs">ffrs lep</span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      A change from closed to open, symbolised by <code>/</code>
      in the variant signature format.
    </dd>
    <dt>Falling edge (<span lang="art-x-Rs">áś lep</span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      A change from open to closed, symbolised by <code>\</code>
      in the variant signature format.
    </dd>
    <dt>Edge or boundary (<span lang="art-x-Rs">ayəron</span>)</dt>
    <dd>Either a rising or a falling edge.</dd>
    <dt>"Valley" (<span lang="art-x-Rs">ssirhc</span> or <span lang="art-x-Rs">ssirc</span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      A closed run that spans exactly one phoneme,
      as in <span lang="art-x-Rs">ow<strong>p</strong>iw</span> (exit strategy, exit of a highway, active escape).
      <span lang="art-x-Rs">owpiw</span> has signatures
      <code>O2<strong>1</strong>2</code> and <code>2<strong>\1/</strong>2</code>.
      One can identify valleys by noticing a <code>\1/</code> in the variant signature format.
    </dd>
    <dt>"Mountain" (<span lang="art-x-Rs">frwéils</span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      A valley, but in reverse. Identified by noticing a <code>/1\</code> in the variant signature format.
      It should be noted that the words <span lang="art-x-Rs">frwéils</span>
      and <span lang="art-x-Rs">ssirc</span>
      do not literally mean valleys and mountains as in the land features.
    </dd>
    <dt>Undulations or pseudosyllables (<span lang="art-x-Rs">alyèlrblucppi</span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      A long chain of alternating open and closed phonemes,
      such as in the word <span lang="art-x-Rs">pessitags</span>
      (repeated opening and closing of an opening, vibration).
      This superficially resembles consonant-vowel pairs of languages that use syllables,
      hence the name "pseudosyllables",
      but keep in mind that the prosody is completely different.
      <span lang="art-x-Rs">Pessitags</span> has signature
      <code>C1111112</code> and <code>1/1\1/1\1/1\2</code>,
      showing that the way to detect undulations
      is to detect lots of consecutive 1s in the signature. 
    </dd>
    <dt>(Undulation) length (<span lang="art-x-Rs">sfléió dfwor</span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      How many 1s an undulation lasts. In the case of the word
      <span lang="art-x-Rs">pessitags</span>, the length is 6.
    </dd>
    <dt>
      Jump-ramp, shore, diving-board, cliff-jump
      (<span lang="art-x-Rs">boingə, bbstti, əttsk, ayəntt</span> respectively)
    </dt>
    <dd>
      These correspond to the four different ways a run of 1 can start and terminate a word.
      They are written <code>1\</code>, <code>/1</code>, <code>1/</code> and <code>\1</code>
      in the alternate scheme respectively.
      The equivalent Rattssaw words are autological, that is,
      <span lang="art-x-Rs">boingə</span> has a jump-ramp,
      <span lang="art-x-Rs">bbstti</span> has a shore,
      and so on.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h1>Phonoruns and words</h1>
  <h2>Non-phonetics</h2>
  <h3>Now that you have described phonoruns, what do you do with them?</h3>
  <p>
    You string one or more of them together to form words, as you will syllables.
    However, you might notice that some of the combinations that you might make
    are very hard to pronounce right,
    and you might be tempted to simplify the transitions between runs.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Wait, <em>between</em> runs?
    Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the monster clusters that happen with the language?
  </h3>
  <p>
    The general theme with run-based languages is that
    staying in a run is cheap (at first), while switching runs is expensive.
    This is why pseudosyllables get their own specific term,
    so as to mark really difficult tongue-twisters.
    As you can imagine, one requires a really different conception
    of what is easy and what is hard
    in order to fluently speak run-based languages.
  </p>
  <h3>Ah. So what about prosody details that span a whole word?</h3>
  <p>Such as?</p>
  <h4>Timing</h4>
  <p>
    Languages that use phonoruns generally have exactly one run per mora.
    In mora-timed phonorun languages,
    this is equivalent to saying that the language is phonorun-timed,
    but of course other modes of timing, such as stress-timed or intial-timed,
    can also apply to phonorun languages.
    Invariably though, stress applies only to open or voiced runs.
    Phonorun languages seemingly never seem to include phonemic stress in Pseudo.
  </p>
  <p>The length of a particular run roughly follows a power law, viz: </p>
  <p class="math">
    \[T(n) = k n^{\frac{3}{2} - \frac{n}{48}}\]
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can see, the power law isn't exact,
    but adding a small correction on the exponent helps greatly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In practical terms, take the nonsense word <i>cacicuceco</i>.
    In an ordinary, syllabic language, that might take five beats,
    one for each ca-ci-cu-ce-co.
    But in a phonorun language, each letter gets its own "beat",
    like c-a-c-i-c-u-c-e-c-o,
    and the word would take 1 second to say completely.
    This is nearly twice as long as the syllabic version.
    Now consider the slightly different word <i>cscscaiueo</i>.
    This word is like the former,
    except the vowels and consonants are pushed to one side.
    Now this word would take a little longer to say in a syllabic language,
    as the giant consonant cluster slows down pronunciation,
    but in a run-based language, it is much faster, about 0.4 seconds or so.
    This is how you can distinguish a phonorun-based language
    from a syllable-based one.
    With another word, <i>akcikcukcekco</i>, this is even more obvious.
  </p>
  <h4>Stress</h4>
  <p>
    Stress in general always lies on open runs,
    as at these points it's easier to make emphasis.
    In this way there is a little bit of a bias
    towards certain types of run when creating stress.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Rattssaw in particular,
    stress is found on the last open run of a "big word"
    (generally a noun or a verb)
    if it has one.
    Otherwise it never gains stress.
  </p>
  <h4>and so on</h4>
  <p>
    Other whole-syllable concepts,
    such as pitch information and accompanying hand gestures,
    can be transferred into phonoruns fairly painlessly,
    at least for those phonoruns that have vocalisation in them
    (it's hard to have tone on a thing that doens't involve your vocal cords.)
  </p>
  <h2>Phonetics</h2>
  <h3>But <em>surely</em> you can't say these things aren't tongue-twisters?</h3>
  <p>
    This is correct, and that does mean that even the most careful speakers
    have some variation on the exact phonetic realisation.
    The main discrepencies between phonemes and phones
    turn out to appear on the boundaries of the run.
    This is called "edge effects".
  </p>
