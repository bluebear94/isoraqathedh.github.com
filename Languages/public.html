<p>This is a post about constructed languages rather than conlanging proper, and certain members of the audience may have already heard about it, and had their views incorporated.</p>
<h1 id="α">§ α</h1>
<p>There’s something about creating a language that makes it not as rewarding as, for instance, maintaining a webcomic or building music. That something is public recognition.</p>
<p>Unlike most visual and aural arts, the public does not have an intuition on what makes a good language, or rather, what <em>doesn’t</em> make a good language, taking into account the inherent asymmetry of quality that says that it’s possible for something to be unambiguously poor quality but nothing to be ambiguously good quality. Ask a random man on the street what makes a good song or a good picture and he’ll say something like “it’s got a strong melody” or “it doesn’t use clashing colours”, and when pressed further he will most likely to be able to give examples and non-examples of quality, even if it is not derived from first principles. For instance, Picasso is a good artist, Nickleback is not. The same man when questioned about what makes a good language would probably mutter something insubstantial about “logical” or “easy to learn” and be unable to provide any (non-)examples beyond his native language(s), English or Esperanto if you are really lucky. Demanding that he provide a constructed language as (non-)examples would be about as fruitful as asking for liquid water on the Sun.</p>
<p>In fact, for most people asking for a what makes a good language is about as coherent as asking for a what makes a good light fixture; languages, like light fixtures, just <em>are</em>, and cannot be judged to be good or bad, no more than you can judge whether <var>g</var> = 9.81 m s<sup>−2</sup> or that the sun rises in the east is good or bad. It’s a given, a backdrop to the world and not actually part of the world itself.</p>
<h1 id="β">§ β</h1>
<p>While this is all just idle speculation, it does have measurable consequences. For those who do eventually pick up conlanging would be deprived of something that the artist or the composer might have an easier time finding: feedback. If you make any of the umpteen thousand rookie mistakes of artistry and post it on the Internet, chances are someone will come along and lecture you about how you’re doing it wrong and why you should be ashamed of yourself. Alternatively someone will come a long and give you pointers to move forward; the point is that you’ll get feedback. With conlangers, this is much harder to come by, and the responses to having created a language usually ranges between “that’s amazing” and “that’s pointless” by the public, neither of which help the would-be conlanger improve his skills.</p>
<p>If the response is toward the “that’s pointless” end of the scale, then our prospective conlanger would likely keep it quiet or drop it altogether; however if it’s “that’s amazing” then he would be bolstered to seek out more. Eventually he would find himself in a conlanging community, with the probability that he would hold his language in high regard. And indeed, breakouts like these do happen. However if it was pointed out that the language is not as good as was thoguht, then it’s very likely the author would feel discouraged or even angry, which is an unfortunate consequence that must be worked around when critiquing a newcomer’s language.</p>
<h1 id="c">§ c</h1>
<p>With all that in mind, it’s hard for me not to feel envious about artists. They have exploited preëxisting human intuition for maximum feedback, and can refine that to make even better feedback and money. Inexplicably, this is particularly strong when looking at webcomic artists, especially particularly popular ones that have created a corporate empire (or at least a duchy) and over 7 kpages of content and probably financed a videogame too. There’s not much that can be done about it, really. Just keep plugging.</p>
