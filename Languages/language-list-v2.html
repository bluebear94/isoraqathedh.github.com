<h1 id="Title">Language List, version 2</h1>
<p>
  This is the webpage that I use to track what languages I have made.
</p>
<h1>Guide to entries</h1>
<p>
  Each language has a handful of short facts,
  followed by a short summary and optionally a sample.
</p>
<p>
  Below are the categories:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Background (B)</dt>
  <dd>Describes what kind of place speaks the language.</dd>
  <dt>Phonology (Φ)</dt>
  <dd>Choice of sounds and combinations of sounds</dd>
  <dt>Orthography (O)</dt>
  <dd>Writing systems, if any</dd>
  <dt>Grammar (G)</dt>
  <dd>General cover term for syntax and morphology as well as derivation</dd>
  <dt>Pragmatics (P)</dt>
  <dd>The lexicon, treatments of context, and so on</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  Each feature has a completeness rating, which is a rating from 0 to 5 blocks:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>[□ □ □ □ □] Planned</dt>
  <dd>
    Nothing has been written down, at all.
    In brainstorming phase.</dd>
  <dt>[■ □ □ □ □] Immature</dt>
  <dd>
    The first draft has been written,
    or at least some framework has been adopted.
  </dd>
  <dt>[■ ■ □ □ □] Developing</dt>
  <dd>
    Things are rapidly taking shape,
    but things can still wildly change as the language component progresses.
  </dd>
  <dt>[■ ■ ■ □ □] Established</dt>
  <dd>
    The system starts gaining quirks of its own.
    Minor changes might still be possible, especially vocabulary
    but for the most part things are solid.
  </dd>
  <dt>[■ ■ ■ ■ □] Clean</dt>
  <dd>
    Largely complete, the system has started to become very unique.
    The details have been homed in, and nothing is poised to change a lot.
  </dd>
  <dt>[■ ■ ■ ■ ■] Mature</dt>
  <dd>
    The system has been given a life of its own.
    The core of the system has stabilised and is unlikely to change further,
    with any such change coming in the form of gaining new examples
    and new exceptions.
    Is likely usable in some limited circumstances.

<h1>Languages of the Jesdic Pasaru</h1>
<p>
  The Jesdic Pasaru is a "grand history" of sort.
  It is, or attempts to be, a description of the development of a civilisation,
  starting from its first signs of life to a fantastical time beyond physics.
  The civilisation is, although human in many ways,
  is decidedly <em>not</em> in others.
  This is reflected in its languages, which though undeniably human-like,
  sometimes have truly alien features.

  <p>
    The official language of the Jesdic Pasaru,
    Egonyota Pasaru is the one language you must learn
    to truly experience life in the Empire,
    being the lingua franca of the Empire and its periphery,
    for certain definitions of “periphery”,
    though its features might be uninteresting as a result.
