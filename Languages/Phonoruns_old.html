Egonyota Pasaru – <i>Untšyerf.</i><br>
Rattssaw – <i>Pwielskk Tayklaymayffcé</i> (literally, severance with the syllables), sometimes jokingly referred to as  <i>ppfssrkśfwá,</i> joining <i>ppfssr</i> (foreign) and <i>srkśfwá</i> (knot), noting how these tend to trip foreigners up.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Some langauges in Pseudo, like <a href="" title="Egonyota Pasaru" class="page">Egonyota Pasaru</a>, simply have so many phonemes it's very hard for them to syllabify them, as the phonemes are used in all sorts of unusual manners. When this happens, the idea of syllables slowly fade away in the mind, and is replaced with the concept of <i>phonemic runs</i>, which abbreviates to <i>phonoruns</i>. Languages that use phonoruns are generally <i>syllabic denialists</i>, but as we will see this term isn't exactly accurate.
</p>

<p>
Since the most common case of syllabic denial is held to be langauges in the Rattssaw family, we shall use <a href="" title="Rattssaw" class="page">Rattssaw</a>, and refer to terms in Rattssaw, to demonstrate how it works.
</p>

<h2>The Phonorun</h2>

<p>
The simplest grouping of phonemes or segments is called a <b>phonorun</b> (sfléió), or a <b>run</b> if context allows. It groups a line of contiguous segments together. Phonoruns have no structure within (that's why they're considered "simpler" than syllables in a way) and therefore are simply just collections, nothing more.
</p>

<p>
However, all segments in a run must have some common property. Sometimes, it's as simple as voicing: the run is a continuous pile of phonemes that are all voiced or unvoiced. Other times, as in Rattssaw, they are horrible and difficult to nail down. We'll discuss below the rather poorly-defined concept of a restrictive and a nonrestrictive phoneme.
</p>

<h3>Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Phonemes</h3>

<p>
To understand the phonorun, one must understand the difference between <b>restrictive</b> and <b>nonrestrictive</b> phonemes. Restrictiveness is an attribute of the phoneme that, essentially, only exists within a given language. Sometimes, restrictiveness is <b>inherited</b> from the letter previously used.
</p>

<p>
As noted before, each language has its idea of what each phoneme is. Rattssaw has three main categories in theory, and two in practice:
</p>

<p>
</p><ol type="1" start="1">
<li><b>Open</b> (þhaər) phonemes are all vowels plus «h».</li>
<li><b>Closed</b> (skkdþ) phonemes are «p b t d pp bb tt dd þ f ff k g kk j ss #»</li>
<li><b>Inheritable</b> (fflayer) phonemes are all remaining phonemes, that is «l r rr þþ z s f x ś m n ng».</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>
Inheritable phonemes are phonemes that inherit their openness and closedness by the last non-inheritable phoneme. Some languages have them, others don't. Their existence generally stabilises phonemes' relative positions, because they make runs longer, and with denialist languages, runs have an optimal length greater than 1 that all runs try to go to. For instance, the name of the writing system of Rattssaw in Rattssaw, "#bezrattssá", would be syllabified as "#b-e-zr-a-ttss-á".
</p>

<h3>Alternative divisions</h3>

<p>
As noted before, arbitrarily dividing phonemes into "open" and "closed" is not the only way one can do the division. Here are some other ways that languages can divide it.
</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Voiced and unvoiced phonemes. These languages often have unvoiced vowels (usually just one, notated /ə̊/)</li>
<li>Front, mid and back phonemes. For vowels these are obvious; for consonants front usually means dental/labial, middle usually means alveolar and back usually means anything further back than velar</li>
<li>High and low phonemes. Again for vowels this is easy; for consonants this usually concerns their manner of articulation.</li>
<li>Pulmonic and non-pulmonic phonemes. Rare because non-plmonics are rare and hard to string together.</li>
<li>Random assignment. This is known in precisely one (as of yet undocumented) language, which has weird properties anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
Even the basic element of a phonorun can change from a segment to, ironically, a syllable, which is treated as an indivisible unit, even though it can be divided as a CV pair (and it is <i>always</i> a CV pair in this case). These syllables are atomic and don't change pronunciations, not even allophonically, which gives support to the thought that they are truly indivisible and atomic.
</p>

<h2>Phonoruns and Words</h2>

<p>
A word is made up of one or more runs. In denialist languages, where pronounciation is usually run-timed, the number of runs in each word is the equivalent to the number of syllables a word has in other languages.
</p>

<h3>Notation and signatures</h3>

<p>
Our example word "#bezrattssá", as noted before, has the following runs in this sequence:
</p>

<p>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
2 Closed, 1 Open, 2 Closed, 1 Open, 2 Closed, 1 Open.
</div>
<p></p>

<p>
We can abbreviate this as:
</p>

<p>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
C2O1C2O1C2O1
</div>
<p></p>

<p>
But since closed and open runs must alternate in Rattssaw (and in most denialist languages as well, as the most common division of phonemes would split the phonemes in two plus a list of inheritable phonemes), all the Cs and Os save the first is unnecessary, and we then arrive at the canonical form of the word's <b>signature</b> (ajalin–#alin, or wálin in some places):
</p>

<p>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
<u>C2121</u>.
</div>
<p></p>

<p>
(Languages that have more than three categories don't usually have this helpful shortening, but in that case some other conventions can be made.)
</p>

<p>
In other cases, it might better to indicate exactly which run has which property. In that case we draw zigzags around the numbers like so:
</p>

<p>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
2̲/1̅\2̲/1̅ (or 2/1\2/1 if the underlines and the overlines break your font.)
</div>
<p></p>

<p>
In languages that have more than two levels, additional distinguishing marks might be necessary to show which type of run is the new one.
</p>

<h3>Anatomy of a word of phonoruns</h3>

<p>
Writing out the boundaries directly crystallises some terms almost immediately:
</p>

<p>
</p><ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Words can be classified as <b>closed-start</b> (gtt kksuər) or <b>open-start</b> (oiw kksuər) based on whether or not the first letter in the word's signature is C or O. Similarly, there are the terms <b>closed-end</b> (gtt élwóuppś) and <b>open-end</b> (oiw élwóuppś), which is easier to identify if we use slashes.</li>
<li>A / would be called a <b>rising edge</b> (ffrś lep), whereas a \ would be called a <b>falling edge</b> (áś lep). The two would collectively be called <b>edges</b> or <b>boundaries</b> (ayəron).</li>
<li>The sequence \1/ is called a <b>valley</b> (ssirhc–ssirc) whereas the sequence /1\ is called a <b>peak</b> (frwéils). Note that the words are unanalysable in Rattssaw and do not refer to literal mountains and valleys.</li>
<li>A long sequence of 1s in the signature (e.g. C41111113) are called <b>undulations</b> (alyèlrblucppi) or <b>pseudosyllables</b>. Undulations have their own closed/open starts and stops, and the number of full waves that appear in it is called its <b>length</b> (sfléió dfwor). They can be seen as many peaks and valleys being joined together.</li>
<li>Should a signature start with 1/, the sole phoneme is called a <b>jump-ramp</b> (boingə). If the signature ends in /1, it is called a <b>shore</b> (bbstti). Similarly, 1\ is called a <b>diving-board</b> (əttsk) and \1 is called a <b>cliff-jump</b> (ayəntt). </li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>
Because of the simple structure of the phonorun, there is otherwise no other special names for the interior of one, unlike the syllable's onset, nucleus, coda and tone. All special phonorun terms describe what happens when two or more of them meet.
</p>

<h3>Edge effects</h3>

<p>
Like syllables, phonemes belonging to the edge of a run can and do interact with each other. These are unsurprisingly called edge effects (ayəron slayérlśtt). However, in some cases when undergoing edge effects a phoneme can drop out of runs entirely, being a brand new run that rarely shares similarities with the other two. These are called detachments (wáəloffldþ). Detachments can sound like they have come from another language sometimes, sometimes even expanding beyond the mouth and affecting the arms, meaning that there are phonemes that are sometimes articulated using the arms.
</p>

<p>
(To be fair, those often involve little more than a twitch. This isn't <a href="" title="Âagenzbèe" class="page">Âagenzbèe</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Rattssaw lacks these edge effects even in the most extreme dialects, but they are seen in sister languages.
</p>

<h2>Phonoruns and the language</h2>

<br>

<h3>Stress and transrun features</h3>

<p>
Languages that use phonoruns generally have exactly one run per mora. In mora-timed phonorun languages, this is equivalent to saying that the language is phonorun-timed, but of course other modes of timing, such as stress-timed or intial-timed, can also apply to phonorun languages. Invariably though, stress applies only to open or voiced runs. Phonorun languages seemingly never seem to include phonemic stress in Pseudo.
</p>

<p>
Tonal phonorun languages, like stress, only display tone in open or voiced runs. Although a language can potentially have unvoiced or closed runs that also have tones, in any case they won't show up when they are spoken directly.
</p>

<h3>Literature</h3>

<br>

<h4>Poetry</h4>

<p>
Poetry uses the idea of phonoruns in phonorun languages just like how syllables are used in syllable languages. Poetry is determined by how many and which combinations of runs are allowed and which ones cannot be. The simplest form of meter in Rattsaw, called the <i>six-in-the-seven</i> (ffpps kksflayddé), has the signature:
</p>

<p>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
Xnnnnnnn<br>
Ynnnnnnn<br>
Xnnnnnnn<br>
Ynnnnnnn<br>
Xnnnnnnn<br>
Ynnnnnnn
</div>
<p></p>

<p>
X and Y are O and C in whichever order, and n can be any positive integer (the ns don't have to be the same). The rhyming scheme, assuming one exists at all, is ABABAB, pretty much by design, as one cannot make consonants and vowels rhyme. In languages with runs of voice and unvoice, this may be different.
</p>

<p>
Simple variations include the <i>six-in-the-seven with peaks and valleys</i> (ffpps kksflayddé ffrwéilsffc ssirhcffcrré), where the middle run is a peak or a valley as appropriate:
</p>

<p>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
Xnnn1nnn<br>
Ynnn1nnn<br>
Xnnn1nnn<br>
Ynnn1nnn<br>
Xnnn1nnn<br>
Ynnn1nnn
</div>
<p></p>

<p>
Further variations are possible, especially with particular care made to the meter and stress.
</p>

<h4>Constrained writing</h4>

<p>
Constrained writing is writing that is written to conform to an unrelated and impractical standard. Because each word has a semantically unrelated symbol – its signature – this type of writing is particularly popular in Rattssaw-speaking regions, and even works that don't otherwise do constrained writing on occasion can still dabble in it, often used in a context-determined way, like a mysterious riddle, or simply used to mark imagery or a suspicious text to the reader without alerting the characters.
</p>

<p>
Riddles in particular are very constrained; if they aren't made of individual segments themselves, then the runs sometimes split up to fit a particular strict pattern:
</p>

<p>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
21113, 21115. 32123, 21114?
</div>
<p></p>

<h2>Psychological effects</h2>

<p>
Foreigners of course would find that whatever eldritch thing speakers are doing with their mouths are nothing but pure witchcraft. It apparently sounds like "someone beatboxing while in the middle of a dental operation", so says Jœsrël, a y_Vohalyo travelling around the world at the time. "Their mouths move ridiculously fast, like the reeds of a musical instrument, and I cannot hope to emulate such incredible speeds."
</p>

<p>
Of course, it goes the other way – recall that a word such as <i>tayklaymay</i> (syllable) has a signature C112111 – six runs, six moras. Whereas, a foreigner would easily syllabify that as <i>tay·klay·may</i> – three syllables, three moras. So the reverse is also true, as noted by the <i>First Description of Rattssaw, Book of the Mouth</i>:
</p>

<p>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
<b>Conclusion</b>. Though the foreigner would say that the phonology of the Rattssaw [the language family that Rattssaw – no article – resides in] is not strictly more difficult than those not of the Rattssaw. Our word for "syllable", <i>tayklaymay,</i> demonstrates that while saying this word is a great feat of the mouth to us, it is no trouble for those from other lands who desire to learn our language. But it is true that our way of thinking about how much one can say at once is not at all the same to those from foreign lands. This is a unique heritage of the Rattssaw, and we hope to preserve it in the future generations.
