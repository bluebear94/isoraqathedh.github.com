title: Language Completion Rubric

In order to gauge the completeness of a language,
I have devised these scales.
They are primarily built to construct a radar diagram,
which looks something like this:

This document attempts to explain how these ratings work, how to understand them,
and, if you so wish, how you may adapt it to your own needs.

# Parameters #
For most languages there are six distinct categories,
mostly orthogonal to each other but all somewhat interdependent,
that can be used to gauge progress.

The important part about these criteria is that they are made as objective as possible.
To this end, all measurements are to a five-milestone, ten-point scale,
and all checks are presence/absence/justification-of-absence checks.
The strength of the justification does not matter,
only that there is one.

## Parameter listing ##

The six parameters are, in a not-entirely-arbitrary order, is:

1. Phonology
2. "Writing" system
3. Grammar
4. Semantics and Pragmatics
5. Corpus
6. World integration.

We will now look at each of those properties, in turn.
