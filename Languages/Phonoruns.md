Syllabic Denial [Title]
===============

Are you a young language? Do you think that syllables are for squares?
Do you want to try some other ways of joining up phonemes together? If
so, then syllabic denial is right for you. In syllabic denial, the idea
of a syllable is replaced by a concept called a phonorun, (sometimes
called a run for short). This document explains how a language works
with phonoruns in a Q&A format.

Usage and prevalence
====================

### Come on. Syllables are universal right?

Yes, bar some particularly interesting examples in the American
Northwest. But that doesn't mean that you can make up something
different yourself. It should be noted that even among Earthling
languages, the idea of what makes a syllable and what doesn't remains
contentious and doesn't stay constant cross-linguistically. The idea of
phonoruns are just to pull it all apart and try moving in a different
direction for a change.

### How can you tell if a language uses phonoruns?

Generally you can tell by its prosody (see below). However for a first
glance, if the language seems to have a lot of convoluted consonant
clusters and similar lengths of vowel clusters, you have good reason to
believe that it is a language that uses phonoruns.

### Do you have a language that can demonstrate phonoruns?

Yes. Throughout this document, I will refer to my conlang, Rattssaw,
which explicitly uses phonoruns to cut up its words. Rattssaw calls
itself \#rattssá. All Rattssaw words will be written in italics.

Basic details
=============

### What is a phonorun?

A phonorun is simply a combination of phonemes that share some specific
properties.

### Where did you get that name from?

I made it up. Natural languages generally don't use this system, so
there's no reason for linguists to give it an official name.

### What's these properties then?

There are two types of properties: intrinsic and extrinsic.

Intrinsic properties are properties that the phoneme has by itself:
voicing, place of articulation, manner of articulation, vowelness,
consonantness etc.. On the other hand, extrinsic properties are assigned
by the language itself and doesn't have to correspond to any particular
quality of the consonant or vowel.

Rattssaw uses an extrinsic property to divide its phonemes into three
different types.

|Name (en)|Name (Rs)|Members|
|:--------|:--------|:------|
|Open|þhaər|Exactly the phonemes «a e i o u á é ó ay wá yé h»|
|Closed|skkdþ|Exactly the phonemes «p b t d pp bb tt dd þ f ff k g kk j ss \#»|
|Inheritable|fflayer|All other phonemes, that is «l r rr þþ z s f x ś m n ng»|

For now, using the orthography is sufficient in understanding how
phonoruns work, so listing their IPA values is superfluous. Yes, even
\#, which unhelpfully has the IPA variable symbol /\#/ for its value.

### Can you have other types of division then?

Yes. Alternative methods of splitting up a phonemes of a language
include:

-   Voiced and unvoiced phonemes. These languages often have unvoiced
    vowels (usually just one, notated /ə̊/).
-   Front, mid and back phonemes. For vowels these are obvious; for
    consonants front usually means dental/labial, middle usually means
    alveolar and back usually means anything further back than velar
-   High and low phonemes. Again for vowels this is easy; for consonants
    this usually concerns their manner of articulation.
-   Pulmonic and non-pulmonic phonemes. Rare because non-pulmonics are
    rare and hard to string together.
-   Random assignment. This is known in precisely one (as of yet
    undocumented) language, which has weird properties anyway.

### Can I have multiple properties to divide upon?

Theoretically this is possible, but this multiplies the complexity and
therefore it's much rarer.

### What does "inheritable" mean?

It means that the letter changes category to conform to the previous
letter. For example, in the word ael (eat), the l is open to conform to
the open e, but in the word clt (modify, alter) The l is closed to
conform to the closed c. The inheritable class is compatible with all
methods of categorization and indeed is fairly common
cross-linguistically.

Describing phonoruns
====================

### What is the equivalent to syl-lab-i-fi-ca-tion?

That would be a word's signature. There are many different types of
signature, but these two are the most common ones, operated on the word
"\#rattssá" , "\#r-a-ttss-á".

The most common system comes from first writing out each run
descriptively: `Closed 2, Open 1, Closed 2, Open 1`, and then condensing
it down to `C2O1C2O1C2O1`. Taking advantage of the fact that any change
in run also indicates a change from open to closed or vice-versa, we can
then write **`C2121`**, which is the first form.

The second form instead focuses on the boundaries of each run, so we
write `2, rise, 1, fall, 2, rise, 1`. This can be intelligibly shortened
to **`2/1\2/1`**.

With other languages, which may have more chategories, alternate systems
can develop. However, Rattssaw has no need for these.

### What do you call each of the bits of a phonorun, like how a syllable has onsets, rimes, etc.?

Phonoruns have no structure inside them, so a lot of the terminology
that comes with them tend to revolve around how they interact with each
other and with the word that they live in. Below are a sampling of
terms.

Closed-start (gtt kksuər)
:   A word that begins with a run of closed phonemes, as in the word
    csunə (the letter C), whose signature is `C23`.
Closed-end (gtt élwóuppś)
:   A word that ends with a run of closed phonemes, as in the word islkk
    (the letter I), whose signature is `O13`.
Open-start (oiw kksuər)  
Open-end (oiw élwóuppś)
:   Analogous to closed-start and closed-end but for runs of open
    phonemes.
Rising edge (ffrs lep)
:   A change from closed to open, symbolised by `/` in the variant
    signature format.
Falling edge (áś lep)
:   A change from open to closed, symbolised by `\` in the variant
    signature format.
Edge or boundary (ayəron)
:   Either a rising or a falling edge.
"Valley" (ssirhc or ssirc)
:   A closed run that spans exactly one phoneme, as in ow**p**iw (exit
    strategy, exit of a highway, active escape). owpiw has signatures
    `O212` and `2\1/2`. One can identify valleys by noticing a `\1/` in
    the variant signature format.
"Mountain" (frwéils)
:   A valley, but in reverse. Identified by noticing a `/1\` in the
    variant signature format. It should be noted that the words frwéils
    and ssirc do not literally mean valleys and mountains as in the land
    features.
Undulations or pseudosyllables (alyèlrblucppi)
:   A long chain of alternating open and closed phonemes, such as in the
    word pessitags (repeated opening and closing of an opening,
    vibration). This superficially resembles consonant-vowel pairs of
    languages that use syllables, hence the name "pseudosyllables", but
    keep in mind that the prosody is completely different. Pessitags has
    signature `C1111112` and `1/1\1/1\1/1\2`, showing that the way to
    detect undulations is to detect lots of consecutive 1s in the
    signature.
(Undulation) length (sfléió dfwor)
:   How many 1s an undulation lasts. In the case of the word pessitags,
    the length is 6.
 Jump-ramp, shore, diving-board, cliff-jump (boingə, bbstti, əttsk, ayəntt respectively) 
:   These correspond to the four different ways a run of 1 can start and
    terminate a word. They are written `1\`, `/1`, `1/` and `\1` in the
    alternate scheme respectively. The equivalent Rattssaw words are
    autological, that is, boingə has a jump-ramp, bbstti has a shore,
    and so on.

Phonoruns and words
===================

Non-phonetics
-------------

### Now that you have described phonoruns, what do you do with them?

You string one or more of them together to form words, as you will
syllables. However, you might notice that some of the combinations that
you might make are very hard to pronounce right, and you might be
tempted to simplify the transitions between runs.

### Wait, *between* runs? Wouldn't it be easier to simplify the monster clusters that happen with the language?

The general theme with run-based languages is that staying in a run is
cheap (at first), while switching runs is expensive. This is why
pseudosyllables get their own specific term, so as to mark really
difficult tongue-twisters. As you can imagine, one requires a really
different conception of what is easy and what is hard in order to
fluently speak run-based languages.

### Ah. So what about prosody details that span a whole word?

Such as?

#### Timing

Languages that use phonoruns generally have exactly one run per mora. In
mora-timed phonorun languages, this is equivalent to saying that the
language is phonorun-timed, but of course other modes of timing, such as
stress-timed or intial-timed, can also apply to phonorun languages.
Invariably though, stress applies only to open or voiced runs. Phonorun
languages seemingly never seem to include phonemic stress in Pseudo.

The length of a particular run roughly follows a power law, viz:

T = constant × n
<sup><sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>\\ +\\ <sup>n</sup>⁄<sub>48</sub></sup>

As you can see, the power law isn't exact, but adding a small correction
on the exponent helps greatly.

In practical terms, take the nonsense word *cacicuceco*. In an ordinary,
syllabic language, that might take five beats, one for each
ca-ci-cu-ce-co. But in a phonorun language, each letter gets its own
"beat", like c-a-c-i-c-u-c-e-c-o, and the word would take 1 second to
say completely. This is nearly twice as long as the syllabic version.
Now consider the slightly different word *cscscaiueo*. This word is like
the former, except the vowels and consonants are pushed to one side. Now
this word would take a little longer to say in a syllabic language, as
the giant consonant cluster slows down pronunciation, but in a run-based
language, it is much faster, about 0.4 seconds or so. This is how you
can distinguish a phonorun-based language from a syllable-based one.
With another word, *akcikcukcekco*, this is even more obvious.

#### Stress

Stress in general always lies on open runs, as at these points it's
easier to make emphasis. In this way there is a little bit of a bias
towards certain types of run when creating stress.

In Rattssaw in particular, stress is found on the last open run of a
"big word" (generally a noun or a verb) if it has one. Otherwise it
never gains stress.

#### and so on

Other whole-syllable concepts, such as pitch information and
accompanying hand gestures, can be transferred into phonoruns fairly
painlessly, at least for those phonoruns that have vocalisation in them
(it's hard to have tone on a thing that doens't involve your vocal
cords.)

Phonetics
---------

### But *surely* you can't say these things aren't tongue-twisters?

This is correct, and that does mean that even the most careful speakers
have some variation on the exact phonetic realisation. The main
discrepencies between phonemes and phones turn out to appear on the
boundaries of the run. This is called "edge effects".

### What?

Here are some
